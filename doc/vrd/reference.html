<h1>Developers Reference</h1>

<p>
The Visual Remote Debugger provides a way to view debugging information, and the PhysX SDK automatically sends physics information when connected. However, nothing really says it must be only physics that is sent to the debugger. Maybe a game object gets strange coordinates and needs to be analyzed, or maybe an AI behaves badly and its parameters needs to be inspected. The information that is automatically supplied by the PhysX SDK can easily be augmented with custom data from the game or application. 
<br><br>
Making an application connect to and use the Visual Remote Debugger is easy and explained in this section:<br>
<a href="reference_connect.html">Connecting to the debugger</a>
<br><br>
To understand how to communicate with the debugger, it is important to know how the application communicates with it. This is explained in this section:<br>
<a href="reference_events.html">Debugger Events</a>
<br><br>

Writing data to the debug stream is not done manually, but through special debugging macros. This section covers how to use them:<br>
<a href="reference_macros.html">Debugger Macros</a>
<br><br>

Even though the protocol itself is defined in a very generic way, the debugger itself does not understand all kinds of data. This reference covers all the object types and what parameters they need:<br>
<a href="reference_objects.html">Debugger Objects</a>
<br><br>

Finally, a simple example shows an imaginary scenario:<br>
