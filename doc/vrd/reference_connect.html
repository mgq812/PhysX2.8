<h1>Developers Reference - Connecting to the debugger</h1>

<p>
To connect to a debugger, the IP of the host computer needs to be known. Usually when debugging PC applications the debugger host is the same computer as the debuggee, in which case "localhost" is the target IP. The following line of code tries to connect to a debugger on localhost, port 5425:
<br><br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="indent">
<tr><td><code><pre class="code">gPhysicsSDK->getFoundationSDK().getRemoteDebugger()->connect ("localhost", 5425);
</pre></code>
</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
If a debugger is not running on the target computer, the connect will fail and the application will continue to function as normal.<br>
<br>As of version 2.7 of the PhysX SDK you can connect to the debugger even when you already have an existing physics setup.
<b>Note:</b> The only thing you need to think of is to not try and connect to the debugger while a scene is simulating.
<br><br>
It is also possible to specify an event mask, to allow only relevant events to be sent to the debugger. This may save performance and bandwidth. By default the eventmask NX_DBG_EVENTMASK_EVERYTHING is specified, which lets all events through. Other masks may be specified like this:
<br><br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="indent">
<tr><td><code><pre class="code">...getRemoteDebugger()->connect ("localhost", 5425, 
	NX_DBG_EVENTMASK_BASIC_OBJECTS | NX_DBG_EVENTMASK_CONTACTS);
</pre></code>
</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
Note that connecting the VRD to the SDK will cause the SDK to collect contact data as though contact notification was enabled.
