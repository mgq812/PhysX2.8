<h1>Visual Remote Debugger - What is it anyway?</h1>

<p>
As in all developing, when developing games using physics there will every now and then appear problems and errors. Detecting and solving these might be a cumbersome task, hindered by the means of interaction the game provides. For example, figuring out if a joint limit is correct might be hard by just firing a gun at it. Usually, to visualize this information properly to be able to verify it, additional debug I/O must be added to the game, which is not always desired. This is where the Visual Remote Debugger comes into play. This tool can be connected to any application using the PhysX SDK (disabling this possibility for releases is of course possible), and provides the means to visualize, manipulate and even record the scene. Since the connection works over network, any host that supports TCP connections can connect to your debugger, be it a PS3, XBox or another PC. Here is a very brief overview of the debugger's features:
<br><br>

<b>Visualize</b><br>
Geometries, joint limits, contact points, etc. Objects and parameters that usually are just numbers in a debugger can now be visualized and understood in full 3D.
<br><br>

<b>Manipulate</b><br>
Pick up objects and throw them around without any additional code in the host application.
<br><br>

<b>Record</b><br>
Found a potential bug, or other strangeness? Record what happens and send to the support; it will reduce misunderstandings and makes a great addition to regular explanations.
