<p>The key ideas underlying the SDK's simulation functionality are described in
this section.</p>

<h2>Scenes</h2>

<p>Simulations take place in scenes (abstracted by the NxScene
class). A scene is a container for a simulation's actors, joints, and effectors.
Several scenes can be created and filled with objects, then simulated in
parallel. The simulation of two scenes is completely disjointed, so objects in
different scenes do not influence each other. However, you may add external
forces which lead to a sort of communication between scenes.</p>

<p>Scenes do not have any particular spatial extents; they can be thought of as
infinite. They also provide various practical functionalities such as a uniform
gravity field that influences all of the contained objects, ray casting,
enabling and disabling collision detection, and so on. Of course, all of these
features only work with the objects that exist in the given scene.</p>

<p>Most simulations will only use a single scene. One practical application for
multiple scenes is a client/server multi player game where a single process
must perform the simulation for the server and a local client. This process would
create two scenes. The client scene would simulate only the immediate
perceivable vicinity of the client's avatar, while the server scene would
simulate the entire world.</p>

<p>A scene can be created by leaving all of the scene descriptor's properties
at their defaults. A common member to set to a special value would be gravity.
The scene gravity may be changed at any time using NxScene::setGravity().</p>
