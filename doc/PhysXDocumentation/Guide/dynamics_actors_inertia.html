<h1 align="center">The Inertia Tensor</h1>
<p>For developers lacking dynamics experience, inertia tensor may be the most unusual aspect of a body. As
mentioned in the Rigid Body Properties section, its purpose is to describe the bodies mass distribution, which may not be available otherwise, since the actual shape is not always stored. Even if shapes are available, sometimes it is preferred to use mass settings not strictly compatible with the
shapes in order to achieve some particular effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus the inertia tensor expresses how hard it is to rotate the shape
in various directions. For example, one can intuitively imagine that a
long thin cylinder (like a printing drum) is easy to turn along its
length axis, but if it were suspended on a chain, it
would be much more difficult to swing around (especially if you push
it near the middle where the chain is attached, as opposed to the ends which give a great deal more
leverage).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Formulas in high school physics books tell you
how to compute the moment of inertia for a particular shape.
Unfortunately, these entry-level books only give you a scalar value,
which is the moment of inertia along some specified axis. In the SDK we
need to use a matrix quantity, which describes the inertia along all
possible axes. The inertia can be expressed either in the local space
of the body or the global space, as can all vector or matrix quantities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Internally, this matrix is decomposed into a rotation and a
vector, which is both faster and more intuitive to use than the dense
matrix because the rotation gives the center of mass an
orientation relative to the actor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you create a body, you will want to specify a moment of
inertia. The default is the identity, which is most likely
inappropriate for your shape. The easiest option is to assign collision
detection shapes to the actor, along with either a density or a total mass. The
inertia tensor will be automatically computed from this data. You may,
of course, set the tensor yourself (having computed it
earlier with the previous method), which is more efficient. The SDK
contains a wide selection of utility functions to compute and
manipulate inertia tensors. See the files
NxExportedUtils.h and NxInertiaTensor.h in the SDK API documentation. Also, 
for meshes, the methods NxConvexMesh::getMassInformation and NxTriangleMesh::getMassInformation
are useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The NxActor methods,</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void setMassSpaceInertiaTensor(const NxVec3 &amp;m);<br>    NxVec3getMassSpaceInertiaTensor();</pre>
<p></p>
<p>let you access the constant diagonal inertia tensor of the actor.
The rotation that is found in the diagonalization of the tensor is
accessed using</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void setCMassLocalOrientation (const NxMat33 &amp;);<br>    NxMat33 getCMassLocalOrientation ();</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The methods,</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void getGlobalInertiaTensor (NxMat33 &amp;dest);<br>    NxMat33 getGlobalInertiaTensorInverse();</pre>
<p></p>
<p>rotate this tensor using the current actor orientation into world
space; as a result, the tensor changes every time the actor moves.<br>
