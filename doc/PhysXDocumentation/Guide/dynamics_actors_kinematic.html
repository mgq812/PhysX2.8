<h1 align="center">Kinematic Actors</h1>
<p>A kinematic actor is a special kind of dynamic actor that is not
moved directly by the user nor by the SDK. This means that it
does not move in response to user forces, gravity, collision
impulses, or if tugged by joints. Further, this type of actor lacks real
velocity or momentum.</p>
<p>Instead, it becomes mobile when the user sets a slightly
different position with the moveGlobal*() functions. NOTE: Do not use
  the setGlobal*() functions to make the actor mobile; it will disable many of the
  advantages that kinematic objects provide, such as having the appearance of
infinite mass and the ability to push regular dynamic actors out of the way.</p>
<p>The move command will result in a velocity that, when successfully
carried out inside simulate() (i.e., the motion is not blocked due to
joints
or collisions), moves the body into the desired pose. After the
move is carried out during a single time step, the velocity is returned
to zero. Thus, the move command must be called in every time step so
kinematic actors can continue along a path. This is because the move functions simply store the move destination until
simulate() is
called, so consecutive calls will overwrite the stored target
variable.</p>
<p>To create a kinematic actor, first create a dynamic actor, and then set
its kinematic flag either in the body descriptor or with
NxActor::raiseBodyFlag(NX_BF_KINEMATIC). When you want the kinematic
actor to become a normal dynamic body again, turn off the kinematic
flag with clearBodyFlag(NX_BF_KINEMATIC). While you do need to provide
a mass for the kinematic body as for all dynamic bodies, this mass will
not actually be used for anything while the actor is in kinematic mode.</p>
<p>Kinematic actors are great for moving platforms or characters where
direct motion control is desired.<br>

<h2>Caveats<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a dynamic actor is
squished between a kinematic and a static or between two kinematics, then it
will have no choice but to get pressed into one of them. In future
versions, it may be possible to have the kinematic motion blocked in this case. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Kinematic actors will collide with
true dynamic actors but not with static actors. This may also change
in the future.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>When calling NxScene::simulate() with a value for elapsedTime
which is not multiple of the sub step size, a different number of sub
steps may be executed due to accumulated fractional sub steps.
If there is a remainder, it will be accumulated until a whole sub step can be executed. The result  is that kinematic actors may not move a constant
distance each time step, since we have the requirement that the
velocity is constant during a sub step.<br>
