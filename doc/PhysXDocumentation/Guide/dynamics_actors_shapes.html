<h1 align="center">Shapes in Actors<br>
</h1>
<h2>Overview
</h2>
<p>An actor typically contains shapes - sometimes one, sometimes more, sometimes none.
The shapes represent the physical space the actor occupies in the simulation, and are
the core of collision detection.</p>
<p>You can create an actor with no shapes, which will then behave as a 'ghost' and collide with
nothing (though it may still be jointed to other actors and affected by gravity and other
applied forces or torques).<br />
However, a shapeless actor must have a body, i.e. it may not be static.</p>
<h2>Usage
</h2>
<p>Shapes are assigned to an actor before creating it, by inserting shape descriptors
into the 'shapes' array of the actor descriptor:
<br>
<pre>    NxSphereShapeDesc shapeDesc;
    //Set properties of the shape
    ... 
    NxActorDesc actorDesc;
    //Set properties of the actor
    ... 
    actorDesc.shapes.pushBack(&shapeDesc);
    gScene->createActor(actorDesc);
</pre>
You can also add shapes to an existing actor using the 'createShape' method of NxActor:
<pre>    NxSphereShapeDesc shapeDesc;
    //Set properties of the shape
    ...
    actor->createShape(shapeDesc);
</pre>
Finally, shapes can be removed from an actor using 'releaseShape'. You cannot
release the last shape of a static actor this way.</p>
The following requirements exist when creating an actor, depending on the shapes making it up:
<ul>
<li>A static actor must have at least one shape.</li>
<li>An actor with no solid shapes (in other words, either no shapes at all or nothing but
trigger shapes) must have a body (i.e. be dynamic), with a specified mass and inertia tensor.</li>
<li>A dynamic actor with solid shapes must have either:
    <ul>
    <li>A non-zero mass, zero density and no inertia tensor (the tensor will be computed based on the mass)</li>
    <li>Zero mass, non-zero density and no inertia tensor (mass and tensor will be computed based on density)</li>
    <li>Zero density, but specified mass and inertia tensor</li>
    </ul>
otherwise the actor will not be created.
</li>
</ul>
See <a href="dynamics_actors_inertia.html">inertia tensor</a> to learn more about the inertia tensor.
<h2>Compound shapes</h2>
<p>Whenever more than one shape are assigned to an actor, a compound shape will be
created automatically. The compound acts as a container for several shapes belonging
to one rigid body. A compound shape is conceptually similar to actors held together 
by fixed joints; however, unlike fixed joints compound shapes are always kept perfectly rigid
and incur no performance cost when simulating.</p>
<p>There are some performance implications of compound shapes that the user should
be aware of:
<ul>
<li>Adding a new shape to a non-compound incurs an overhead as a compound shape
is created and the old shape is moved into it.</li>
<li>Adding shapes to an existing compound is more time-consuming than creating
the actor with all shapes at once.</li>
<li>You should avoid static actors being compounds; there's a limit to the number of triangles allowed in one actor's mesh shapes and subshapes
exceeding the limit will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
