<h1 align="center">Mesh Paging</h1>

To allow support for large static meshes when using the hardware, it is
necessary  to explicitly control mesh paging to the
hardware. When a mesh is <a href="collision_cooking.htm">cooked</a>
the user must specify an additional flag to generate a pageable format
which can be used with the PPU.<br>
<br>
The flag NX_MF_HARDWARE_MESH is applied to the flags member of
NxSimpleTriangleMesh/NxTriangleMeshDesc before cooking. Cooking splits
the mesh into convex segments, which are then grouped into pages for
the hardware.<br>
Note that a mesh must be hardware cooked in order to perform collision
detection with any hardware objects. Thus even a mesh in a master scene
on software must set NX_MF_HARDWARE_MESH to be able to collide with objects
in a hardware rigid body compartment (see <a href="hardware_compartments.html">Compartments</a>).<br />

<br>
When the mesh is loaded into a hardware scene, the user can
retrieve a bounding box for each mesh page, and use this
information to upload appropriate pages to the card to support their
simulation.<br>
<br>
<pre>    NxU32 NxTriangleMesh::getPageCount() const;<br>    NxBounds3 NxTriangleMesh::getPageBBox(NxU32 pageIndex) const;</pre>

To map pages for a particular shape:<br>
<br>
<pre>    bool NxTriangleMeshShape::mapPageInstance(NxU32 pageIndex);<br>    void NxTriangleMeshShape::unmapPageInstance(NxU32 pageIndex);<br>    bool NxTriangleMeshShape::isPageInstanceMapped(NxU32 pageIndex);</pre>

mapPageInstance() will return true if the page has been successfully
uploaded to the PPU; otherwise, it will return false. In the case where a page cannot
be uploaded to the hardware, the user should unmap a number of pages
using unmapPageInstance() to make room for the new pages.<br>
<h2>Automatic mesh paging</h2>
 <p>It is possible to have the SDK page meshes automatically, 
 as needed, whenever broadphase overlaps indicate it. Use the NxTriangleMeshShapeDesc::meshPagingMode member to enable automatic paging. The member can take the following values:-</p>
 <ul>
   <li> NX_MESH_PAGING_MANUAL - Mesh paging is left to the user.</li>
   <li>     NX_MESH_PAGING_FALLBACK - Automatic SW fallback when needed pages are not mapped.</li>
   <li>     NX_MESH_PAGING_AUTO			- Automatic mesh paging. Pages are mapped to hardware when broadphase overlaps are detected </li>
 </ul>
 <p>   Note that automatic mesh paging works in parallel to the normal manual scheme; this means
   that a mesh page is fetched when either the SDK or the user (through mapPageInstance) wishes it - 
   and it is unmapped only when <i>both</i> the SDK and the user (through unmapPageInstance) wish it.
   The user can thus force a page mapping to occur before collision is imminent, in order to e.g. prevent
   performance spikes.<br>
   <br>
   Alternatively, you can use the NX_MESH_PAGING_FALLBACK flag in order to have the SDK fall back to software
 mode for meshes that have not been paged into the hardware.</p>
 <p>Care should be taken when using automatic mesh paging as the paging process may stall the simulation for a significant amount of time causing large spikes in the simulation time. ie User intervention to map appropriate pages ahead of time may be needed. </p>
 <p>Also note that mesh paging may not be required for cases where the simulation falls back to software. For example heightfield meshes are not simulated in hardware and will always execute in software (version 2.5). <br>
