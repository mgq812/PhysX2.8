<h1 align="center">SDK Initialization</h1>

<p>To become familiar with the SDK and how to use it, below is a walk through of
the SampleBoxes demo
application source code. It can be found in the file /SampleBoxes/src/NxBoxes.cpp.</p>

<p>The symbols of the SDK may be included in the user's relevant source
files through the following header:</p>

<pre>	#include &quot;NxPhysics.h&quot;</pre>

<p>If your application uses windows.h included before the SDK, you must suppress its definition of the macros min and
max, as these are common C++ method names in the SDK. To do so, use the following:</p>

<pre>	#define NOMINMAX<br>	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</pre>

<p>Start up the Physics SDK with the following:</p>

<pre>	gPhysicsSDK = NxCreatePhysicsSDK(NX_PHYSICS_SDK_VERSION, &amp;myAllocator, &amp;myOutputStream);</pre><pre>	if(</span>!gPhysicsSDK)Error(&quot;Wrong SDK DLL version?&quot;);</pre>

<p>The first argument is the version number defined in the SDK headers. This
makes certain that the include files you are using define the same version of
the classes that the DLL contains. If there is a version mismatch, an error is
reported and NULL is returned.</p>

<p>The second argument is an optional memory allocation object, and may be
NULL. See <a href="basics_memory.html">Memory Management</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>The third argument is an optional output stream object, and may be NULL. See
<a href="basics_errorreporting.html">Error Reporting</a> for more information.</p>

<p>When the call is successful, you will have a pointer to an <span
class=SpellE>NxPhysicsSDK</span> interface.</p>

<p>When you are finished using the SDK, you must release it. Releasing the SDK, with the method shown below, automatically releases all of the SDK objects you created: </p>

<pre>	gPhysicsSDK-&gt;release();</pre>

<p>If NxCreatePhysicsSDK is called more than once, the same actual object is returned (as it is
a singleton class). However, since there is a reference counter for the singleton, you must match
each call with a call to release().<br>
The allocator argument will be ignored for any calls past the first, but the output stream will be changed.</p>
