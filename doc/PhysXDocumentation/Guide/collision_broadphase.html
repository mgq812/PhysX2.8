<h1 align="center">Broad Phase Collision Detection</h1>
<p>The first step of collision detection is to find out which pairs of
objects from all the possible pairs in a scene have a chance of
touching.
Because there are approximately n*n/2 potential pairs in a set of n
shapes,
checking all of them is too time consuming for large scenes. Instead,
the SDK
automatically partitions the space occupied by the shapes. This way a
shape
is only tested against nearby shapes. </p>
<p>NOTE: In previous versions, the SDK
allowed selection of the broadpahse algorithm. Support for this has
been dropped as  the default is best.</p>
<h2>Shape Pair Filtering</h2>
<p>Once a pair of shapes is identified as possibly colliding, three
consecutive checks are performed to see if the user is interested in
the
pair. Only after all three checks pass will time consuming contact
determination be performed. Collision detection between shapes a
and b
occurs if the following is true:</p>
<pre>    (a-&gt;getActor()-&gt;isDynamic() || b-&gt;getActor()-&gt;isDynamic())<br>        &amp;&amp; NxScene::getGroupCollisionFlag(a-&gt;getGroup(), b-&gt;getGroup())<br>        &amp;&amp; (!(NxScene::getShapePairFlags(a,b) &amp; NX_IGNORE_PAIR))</pre>
<p>The first test simply means that static objects which cannot move
anyway do
not collide against each other. We look at the last three conditions
in the following sections.</p>
<p>In addition to the above checks, an additional mechanism for contact
filtering which uses bit masks and boolean operations can be applied.
See <a href="collision_filtering.html">Contact Filtering</a> for more information. </p>
<p>Collisions between pairs of jointed
bodies are disabled by default. To enable collisions between jointed
bodies the NX_COLL_VETO_JOINTED parameter can be set to false. See <a
 href="basics_sdkparameters.html">SDK Parameters</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Collision Groups</h2>
<p>The first condition checks the shapes collision group membership.
All
shapes can be assigned to a collision group with the following call:</p>
<pre>    NxShape::setGroup(NxCollisionGroup)</pre>
<p>The CollisionGroup is simply an integer between 0 and 31. For
example, the
below call assigns our shape to the 11th group:</p>
<pre>    myShape-&gt;setGroup(11);</pre>
<p>All shapes start out in group 0, but this does not really come with
any
built in meaning. The SDK maintains a 32x32 symmetric Boolean matrix
which
identifies whether or not shapes of a particular group should be collided against shapes
of
another group. Initially, all group pairs are enabled. You can change
the
entries of the matrix with the following call:</p>
<pre>    NxScene::setGroupCollisionFlag(CollisionGroup g1, CollisionGroup g2, bool enable);</pre>
<p>For example, the below call disables collisions between group 11 and
group
0:</p>
<pre>    gScene-&gt;setGroupCollisionFlag(11, 0, false);</pre>
<p>Collision groups are useful if you know ahead of time that there are
certain kinds of actors which should not collide with certain other
kinds.</p>
<p>Actors can also be assigned to groups. Actor groups are orthogonal
to
shape groups, even though they are used for similar things. They work
the
same way, however there are 0x7fff possible actor groups, instead of
only 32
as with shapes. This allows for more flexibility. First, each actor can
be
assigned to a group as shown below:</p>
<pre>    myActor-&gt;setGroup(333);</pre>
<p>By default each actor starts out in group 0. Next, set up
relationships between pairs of actor groups:</p>
<pre>    gScene-&gt;setActorGroupPairFlags(333,334, NX_NOTIFY_ON_START_TOUCH | NX_NOTIFY_ON_END_TOUCH);</pre>
<p>A combination of the following flags are permitted:</p>
<p>NX_NOTIFY_ON_START_TOUCH, NX_NOTIFY_ON_END_TOUCH, NX_NOTIFY_ON_TOUCH.</p>
<p>See&nbsp;the section on <a href="collision_triggers.htm">Triggers</a> for an explanation of
these&nbsp;flags.</p>
<h2>Disabling Pairs</h2>
<p>The second broad phase condition checks to see if a pair
that is
about to be collision tested has been disabled or not. Any
pair of actors or shapes can be disabled with the following call:</p>
<pre>    NxScene::setActorPairFlags(NxActor&amp;, NxActor&amp;, NxU32 flags);<br>   &nbsp;NxScene::setShapePairFlags(NxShape&amp;, NxShape&amp;, NxU32 flags);</pre>
<p>The second method is useful if  an actor is made up of multiple
shapes, and you only want to disable collisions between some of them.
If this is the case, the only flag of interest is NX_IGNORE_PAIR.  For
example,
the below call disables collisions between the two actors passed:</p>
<pre>    gScene-&gt;setActorPairFlags(a1, a2, NX_IGNORE_PAIR);
</pre>
<p>NOTE: Other possible flags for the setActorPairFlags() call will be discussed later.
<h2>User actor filtering</h2>
It is possible to provide a custom method for actor pair filtering. This gives you total control over which
actors can interact with which. To enable this feature, do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Implement the NxUserActorPairFiltering interface, including the onActorPairs callback. This callback
        will be called with arrays of actor pairs, for each of which you may specify whether to filter that pair
        out or not.</li>
    <li>Set the NX_AF_USER_ACTOR_PAIR_FILTERING flag for any actors you wish to involve in custom filtering.</li>
    <li>Whenever you change the policy used in your callback, or change the callback itself, you need to
        also call NxActor::resetUserActorPairFiltering() for each actor that would change its filtering state 
        with regard to any of its current interactions (to be safe you may want to simply call it for every actor
        with the flag set). Otherwise the changed policy would have no effect until the pair separated and contacted
        once more.</li>
</ul>
Custom user actor pair filtering overrides any other actor pair filtering.
