<p>
The SDK transparently handles cooking of triangle mesh geometry and
mirroring of dynamic/static shapes into a hardware fluid scene. 
It cooks mesh data on the fly for the fluid scene as the
particles from the fluid intersect the AABBs of rigid body
geometry.</p>
<p>
This makes it easy to integrate fluid support into an existing
application. Simply call NxScene::createFluid() on your scene and
the SDK will take care of the rest.</p>
<h2>2-way interaction</h2>
<p>PhysX by default allows objects of the software rigid body compartment to affect a 
fluid compartment, and not vice versa; however, this can be changed.<br>
2-way interaction of fluids and rigid bodies are disabled on two levels by default:
<ul>
	<li>NxFluid</li>
	<li>NxShape</li>
</ul>
To enable the interaction, both the corresponding shape flag as well as the fluid 
flag must be set:
<pre>fluidDesc.flags |= NxFluidFlag::NX_FF_COLLISION_TWOWAY;<br>
shapeDesc.flags |= NxShapeFlag::NX_SF_FLUID_TWOWAY;</pre>
The interaction is not necessarily symmetrical; the collision Response Coefficient 
defines which fraction of the collision impulse actually 
gets applied to the colliding rigid body:
<pre>fluidDesc.collisionResponseCoefficient = 0.8f;</pre>
The default collision response coefficient is 0.2.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shape and actor properties other than pose and velocity are not updated during runtime, 
with the exception of collision/trigger/drain flags for dynamic shapes and actors. Flags for 
static shapes and actors don't get updated.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The runtime creation and removal of triangle based static shape types 
is not mirrored correctly. If such a shape is created during simulation, it is not guaranteed 
that particles in the scene will collide with it. Also, if such a shape is removed during simulation, 
particles in the scene may still collide with it. This applies to the following shape types:<br>
<pre>
static triangle mesh shapes<br>
static heightfield shapes<br>
static convex shapes<br>
</pre>
  </li>  
  <li>Performance of the scene manager is dependent on
the triangle density of objects within the bounding boxes of fluid. Thus,
a heavily tessellated mesh may cause a stall while the mesh data
is transformed into a form suitable for upload to the hardware.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Because of the way the compartment interacts with the scene, fluids cannot interact
	directly with cloth, and indirectly (through interacting with rigid bodies in the scene
	proper) only with a delay.</li>
  <li>There's a limit of 8192 mesh triangles interacting with a fluid packet; packets exceeding this 
    will exhibit particles penetrating solid objects. The packet size must thus not be too large
    compared to the triangle density of meshes.</li>
</ul>
