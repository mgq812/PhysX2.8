<h1 align="center">Applying Forces and Torques</h1>
<p>The most physics friendly way of interacting with a body is to apply
 external force. In classical mechanics, most interactions
between bodies are typically solved by using force because of
the following law:</p>
<pre>    f = m a (force = mass * acceleration)</pre>
<p>Force directly controls a body's acceleration, and indirectly controls its velocity and
position. For this reason, control by force may be
inconvenient if you need immediate response. Its advantages, however, are regardless of what type you apply to the bodies in the scene,
the simulation will be able to keep all the defined constraints (joints
and contacts) satisfied. The spring and damper effector and gravity
also work by applying  force to bodies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, applying large forces to articulated bodies at the
resonance frequency of the system may lead to ever-increasing
velocities, and eventually to the failure of the
constraint solver to maintain the joint constraints. This is not unlike
a real world system where the joints would simply break.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The forces acting on a body are accumulated before each simulation
frame, applied to the simulation, and then reset to zero in preparation
for the next frame. You can apply your own forces and torques to a body
in a variety of ways. The relevant methods of NxActor are listed below.
Please refer to the API reference to see further detail:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void addForceAtPos(const NxVec3 &amp; force, const NxVec3 &amp; pos, NxForceMode);<br>    void addForceAtLocalPos(const NxVec3 &amp; force, const NxrVec3 &amp; pos, NxForceMode);<br>    void addLocalForceAtPos(const NxVec3 &amp; force, const NxVec3 &amp; pos, NxForceMode);<br>    void addLocalForceAtLocalPos(const NxrVec3&amp; force, const NxVec3&amp; pos, NxForceMode);</pre>
<pre>    void addForce(const NxVec3 &amp;, NxForceMode);<br>    void addLocalForce(const NxVec3 &amp;, NxForceMode);<br>    void addTorque(const NxVec3 &amp;, NxForceMode);<br>    void addLocalTorque(const NxVec3 &amp;, NxForceMode);</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The NxForceMode member defaults to NX_FORCE to apply simple forces.
Use NX_IMPULSE to apply an
impulsive force. NX_VELOCITY_CHANGE also applies impulsive force, but ignores
the mass of the body, effectively leading to an instantaneous velocity
change. See the API documentation of NxForceMode for more
options.</p>
<h2>Gravity</h2>
<p>Gravity is such a common force in simulations that we have made it
particularly simple to apply. If you need a scene-wide gravity
effect, or any other uniform force field, you can apply the NxScene
class' gravity vector using setGravity().</p>
<p></p>
<p>The parameter is the acceleration due to gravity vector. If you work
with meters and seconds, this equals about a 9.8 magnitude on earth. It should point downwards in your scene. The force that
will be applied at each body's center of mass  is this
acceleration vector multiplied by the actor's mass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, certain special effects can require that some dynamic
actors not be influenced by gravity. To do
this you can call NxActor::raiseBodyFlag(NX_BF_DISABLE_GRAVITY).<br>
</p>
<p>NOTE: Be careful
changing gravity (or enabling/disabling) during the simulation. The
change will not wake up sleeping actors for performance reasons. It
may be necessary to iterate through all actors and call
NxActor::wakeUp() manually.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
