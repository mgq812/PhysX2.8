<h1 style="text-align: center;">Triangle Mesh</h1>
<p>A triangle mesh is helpful in creating complex shapes that are
too
complex to represent with a bunch of boxes and spheres, or  a better option than spending time to tediously fit
these
bounding boxes.</p>
<p>There are four basic ways that triangle meshes are provided to
the SDK:</p>
<ul>
  <li>convex mesh </li>
  <li>heightfield mesh </li>
  <li>arbitrary open mesh</li>
  <li>arbitrary closed mesh with a pmap (<i>NOTE: PMaps have been deprecated.</i>)</li>
</ul>
  <p>Each of these
    mesh
    types have the same API interface, but the collision detection codes they
    use 
    when in contact with different shape types may be different. For a list of collision interactions applicable to mesh shapes see <a
 href="collision_Interactions.html">Collision Interactions</a>.
  <p>Collision detection is less robust against triangle meshes than between primitives such as spheres or boxes.
  In particular, a primitive that, due to excessive velocity or imprudent insertion, ends up with its center
  inside the triangles of a triangle mesh will <i>not</i> register a collision. <a href="collision_ccd.htm">Continuous collision detection</a> (CCD)
  can help with this problem.</p>
	<p>The common practice of storing a single triangle mesh and then
creating
several differently posed instances of it is mirrored in the SDK by creating an NxTriangleMesh object and then a number of
NxTriangleMeshShapes
which reference it. The NxTriangleMesh shapes can be attached to actors
and
transformed individually.</p>
<p>To create a triangle mesh object it is necessary to first cook the
data.
See the following section on <a href="collision_cooking.htm">Cooking</a> for more information. </p>
