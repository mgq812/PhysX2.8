<h1 style="text-align: center;">Twist and Swing</h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Twist and swing coordinates for 3D orientation
are based on its decomposition into a two orthogonal
rotation sequence. They sit between Euler angle decompositions into a
three orthogonal rotation sequence and direct representations   of the single shortest rotation axis/angle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the twist and swing decomposition, an
orientation is achieved by a sequence of two rotations:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">(1) a twist rotation about a selected axis and
(2) a swing rotation about an axis in its perpendicular plane.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hence, twist describes the DOF spin about the
selected twist axis, while swing describes the direction
in space of the twist axis. With two bodies involved, the twist and
swing decomposition is based on a selected twist axis in both the
parent and child; the twist axis in the parent acts as the central
reference direction relative to which the swing direction of the child
twist axis is measured.</p>
<h2> Globe Visualization</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Imagine the twist axis as a radius tracing out
points on the globe as it swings and the central reference swing
direction positioned towards the North Pole. A swing rotation plots a point
from the North Pole to the target point by following the shortest path
on the sphere - a line of longitude in this case.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The swing rotation axis lies in the plane
of the equator 90 degrees east of the swing longitude. NOTE: The direction is
computed from the cross product of the parent and child twist axes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Now set a zero reference for twist as a given
heading at the North Pole. This twist reference is transferred to other
target points on the globe by maintaining the heading along the
shortest path to the target point. This is an isotropic definition of
twist in that it is independent of the swing direction to the target
point.</p>
<h2>The Singularity at Full-Swing</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The South Pole is a problem case because there
is no unique single shortest path from the North Pole; all lines of
longitude meet at both poles, therefore a 180 degree swing rotation around any
arbitrary equatorial axis takes a point from the North to the South
Pole. Twist cannot be defined and swing is redundant.</p>
<h2>Twist Parameter</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Twist can be specified and stored as an angle; however, performing the rotation requires trig functions to be
evaluated. Therefore, it is more efficient to store a pre-computed trig function, which will be demonstrated later in this section.</p>
<h2>Swing Parameters as Rotation Vector Components</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Swing is parameterized by the two Cartesian
coordinates of its rotation vector in the equator plane. The
swing direction is inherent in the direction of the vector, i.e., the
relative values of its two coordinates. The swing angle is encoded in
the magnitude of the vector, i.e., its length as given by the norm of
its two coordinates. The options of suitable trig functions for mapping
angle to magnitude is covered below.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Note that swing is NOT parameterized by
swing-angle and swing-direction, or latitude and longitude angles as
a picture of the globe might seem to suggest; these are the natural
coordinates for a pair of sequential Euler angle rotations rather than
two parameters of a single rotation. They are
singular at the origin; namely, the North Pole, where swing-angle is zero
and swing-direction is redundant.</p>
<h2>Swing Parameters as Projected Components</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The two swing parameters can also be seen as
components of the twist axis projected flat onto the equatorial plane.
The equivalent rotation vector lays 90 degrees east of the projected
axis. The projection is more general than just a shadow; it can be any
suitable function for mapping angle to magnitude.</p>
<h2>Choice of Projection for Mapping Magnitude</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The angle itself is an obvious choice for the
magnitude function; however, to execute the rotation requires
costly sine and cosine evaluations. Below are four trig
functions based on spherical projections in order of increasing
suitability for numerical work.</p>
<h3> sin-angle</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The cross product of the parent and child twist
axes is a vector in the direction of the swing rotation axis. Its
magnitude is the sine of the swing angle. This corresponds to
parallel projection form, a light source far above the North Pole. However, note that the shadow of the twist axis on the equatorial plane does not
distinguish a North hemisphere point from its reflection through the
equator in the South hemisphere.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sine function is not a suitable
magnitude-mapping function because it only works for angles up to
90 degrees.</p>
<h3>tan-half-angle</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This choice is of more theoretical than
practical use.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A light source located at the South Pole maps
all North hemisphere points to inside the equator and South hemisphere
points to outside the equator; however, as the South Pole is approached, the
image goes to infinity. This is the stereographic projection. Its
magnitude is the tangent of half the swing angle. This projection is
the unique conformal projection between the sphere and the plane in
that it preserves all angles. Circles on the sphere generally map to
circles on the plane except for great circles which map to straight
lines.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Instead of the familiar 2-sphere, i.e., a 2D
spherical surface embedded in 3D space, imagine the 3-sphere, the
space inhabited by unit quaternions, as a 3D spherical surface embedded in
4D space. In fact, only half the 3-sphere is needed because diametrically
opposite points represent the same orientation. The tan-half-angle
projection is the central projection from the hemi-3-sphere onto the
tangent (hyper) plane at its pole! In the central projection, the light
source is placed at the center of the sphere.</p>
<h3>sin-half-angle</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This choice corresponds to the magnitude of the
vector part of the quaternion which makes it convenient for
computations. It would seem that accuracy could be lost as the angle
approaches 180 degrees, because the gradient approaches zero, but this can
be overcome by generating the scalar part of the quaternion, i.e.,
cos-half-angle, a computation that requires a square root.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This is the parallel projection from the
hemi-3-sphere of quaternions into 3D space.</p>
<h3> tan-quarter-angle</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This corresponds to the stereographic projection
from the quaternion sphere into 3D space. It is the unique
conformal projection from the space of rotations into Euclidean space.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It is easy to compute the quaternion (cos-half-angle and sin-half-angle) from tan-quarter-angle.</p>
<h2>Twist and Swing is not Axis and Angle</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Do not confuse swing and twist with
axis-and-angle. Both describe the direction of an axis and an angle of
rotation about that axis. The difference is in the definition of the
axis.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The axis-and-angle axis is the axis of the
single shortest rotation. It is not fixed in the world or the body; its
arbitrary direction in space is decided by the difference between
reference and required orientations. The angle is the magnitude of the
single shortest rotation between the orientations.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The twist and swing axis is a physical axis
fixed in the body. Its direction is specified by a swing rotation about
an axis in the perpendicular plane. The twist angle specifies a second,
orthogonal, decoupled rotation about the axis.</p>
<h2> Twist and Swing Decomposition in Quaternion Components</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This section shows how the twist and swing
decomposition is done with quaternion mathematics.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The quaternion representing the general 3D
orientation is written below, </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Qxyz = (Qw, Qx, Qy, Qz)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">with 'w' indexing the scalar and 'x','y','z' indexing the
components of the vector. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the x-axis is the special axis in defining twist and swing, then the decomposition is
computed in quaternion multiplication, Qxyz=Qswing Qtwist, with the following: <br>
<img alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq1.PNG"
 style="width: 803px; height: 82px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The proof begins by writing the quaternion
representing the twist rotation around the x-axis as,</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Qtwist =
Qx = (Cx, Sx, 0, 0) </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">and the quaternion representing the swing
rotation around an axis in the yz-plane with the following: </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center">Qswing
= Qyz = (Cyz, 0, Sy, Sz)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Below, 'c' represents the scalar and 's' represents the vector components in relation to
the cosine and sine of the half angles:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img
 alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq2.PNG"
 style="width: 607px; height: 87px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Remember that generally<img alt=""
 src="images/6dof_twistswingEq3.PNG" style="width: 198px; height: 34px;">&nbsp;so
we have<img alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq4.PNG"
 style="width: 285px; height: 37px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Using quaternion multiplication, the rotations
compose right-to-left just like rotation matrices, shown below: </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img
 alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq5.PNG"
 style="width: 392px; height: 43px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The rotations are treated as active rotations
around global fixed axes rather than the current local axes. Expanding
the quaternion multiplication looks like this: </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img
 alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq6.PNG"
 style="width: 566px; height: 42px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Extracting the twist quaternion from this is
straightforward once you see that Qw^2 + Qx^2 =&nbsp; Cyz^2</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;<img alt=""
 src="images/6dof_twistswingEq7.PNG" style="width: 503px; height: 58px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Then the swing quaternion is extracted by
inverting (conjugating) the twist quaternion and multiplying</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img
 alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq8.PNG"
 style="width: 559px; height: 45px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Expanding the quaternion multiplication gives</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img
 alt="" src="images/6dof_twistswingEq9.PNG"
 style="width: 647px; height: 45px;"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">which completes the proof.<br>
