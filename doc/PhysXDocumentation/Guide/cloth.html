<h1 style="text-align: center;">Cloth</h1>
The cloth feature of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK allows for simulation of items made from cloth, such as flags, clothing, etc.
This is accomplished by providing a mesh that is used to define a set
of particles (vertices). The topology of the mesh allows the SDK to
construct constraints between the particles that mimic how cloth
can bend and stretch. In addition, cloth particles can be pinned to
shapes and global positions, such as attaching a flag to a pole.<br>

There are two main types of cloth constraints:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Stretching - applied to maintain distance between each particle that is
connected by an edge in a cloth mesh.  The strength  of this
constraint is assigned using the SDK; specifying a small stretching constraint factor allows the
particles to move apart more easily and gives the impression of
more stretchy cloth, such as lycra. Specifying a larger constraint factor makes the cloth stiffer, like denim.</li>
  <br>
<br>
<li>Bending -  applied to maintain the
angle along an edge in a cloth mesh, either by constraining the angle directly or by constraining the distance between the pair of particles on either side of the
edge (see the diagram below). An example of a material that would use a low
bending constraint for simulation is cotton, while a substance such as paper or cardboard would use a 
high bending constraint.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To create stiff cloth:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Use fewer vertices (fewer vertices makes stiffer cloth).</li>
      <li>Use higher iteration counts (associated performance impact).</li>
      <li>Use NX_CLF_BENDING_ORTHO mode (results in stiffer, more
realistic cloth bending).<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To improve  cloth performance:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Use fewer vertices.</li>
      <li>Use simple bending constraints (NX_CLF_BENDING and not
NX_CLF_BENDING_ORTHO).</li>
      <li>Disable cloths that are not relevant using NX_CLF_STATIC.</li>
      <li>Disable tearing for cloths which do not need tearing.</li>
      <li>Avoid cloth self collision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li></ul>
 <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloth collisions only take account of one constraint
per particle per timestep. This means that in some cases a cloth can
slip through a concave corner during mesh or terrain collisions. A
workaround  is to increase the cloth's thickness or bending stiffness
 to prevent cloth constraints from bending around the
concave edge.</li>
      <li>When using two way interaction, it is important to set the appropriate density of the attached objects. If an object
with a very low or high density is attached to a cloth then the
simulation may behave poorly.</li>
      <li>Collision detection is only performed
with cloth vertices, so if a cloth is stretched far enough objects will
be able to slip between them.      </li>
    </ul>
