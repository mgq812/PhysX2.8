<h1 align="center">Spring and Damper Element</h1>
<p>While technically not a joint, this is a good place to explain the
general spring and damper element implemented by the
NxSpringAndDamperEffector class because it exerts a force between two
bodies, proportional to the relative positions and/or the relative
bodies' velocities.</p>
<p>Create the element like any other dynamics object:</p>
<pre>    NxSpringAndDamperEffectorDesc sdd;</pre>
<pre>    NxSpringAndDamperEffector * effector = scene-&gt;createSpringAndDamperEffector(sdd);</pre>
<p>The descriptor does not yet have any interesting settings. Next, tell it between which two actors it is to act, and where
exactly on the actors (but in global space) the two ends of the
effector are attached:</p>
<pre>    effector-&gt;setBodies(actor1,positon1, actor2, position2);</pre>
<p>When the above call is made, the effector reads the bodies' poses
so that it can remember what the relative position is when the spring
is relaxed. At this initial position, no spring force is applied. When
 the spring is stretched or compressed by moving the bodies relative
to each other, a force will be exerted. The magnitude of this force is
controlled by the NxSpringAndDamperEffector::setLinearSpring() method.
See the API reference for explanation about its parameters.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the two bodies begin moving relative to each other,
they will have a relative velocity. The damping force, which is always
trying to stop the bodies, is a function of this velocity. The exact
magnitude of the damping force is controlled by the
NxSpringAndDamperEffector::setLinearDamper() method.</p>
<p>This effector element is not as numerically stable as the
NxSpringDesc spring elements built into certain types of joints.</p>
<p>NOTE: The spring and damper element is deprecated, therefore, the
distance joint should be used in its place for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><!--StartFragment --> Spring and Damper elements are not as
numerically stable as genuine joints. </li>
  <li> Joints have proper sleep behavior - bodies fall asleep and
wake up at appropriate times with regard to forces being transferred
across the&nbsp;joint's spring. </li>
</ul>
