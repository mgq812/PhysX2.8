<h1 align="center">Casting and Instancing</h1>
<p>Instances of class interfaces cannot be created with the C++ new
operator
because they are pure virtual classes. The instance of the first class
created, NxPhysicsSDK, is returned by the NxCreatePhysicsSDK function,
discussed in the <a href="basics_init.html">SDK Initialization</a>
section.</p>
<p>Many SDK interfaces contain create* methods that return instances of
other
types. These methods are used to create SDK objects. To avoid overly
long
parameter lists and receive aid in error checking, the SDK uses
descriptor classes to
pass creation parameters. The descriptor is a temporary variable only
needed
for the duration of the creation call. You can allocate it as a stack
variable.
Below we will create a scene as an example. For this we need a scene
descriptor:</p>
<pre>	NxSceneDesc sceneDesc;</pre>
<p>The scene descriptor initializes itself to some default values which
will
not suffice, in most cases, to create an object. The user may,
therefore, override
these parameters:</p>
<pre>	sceneDesc.gravity.set(0,-9.8f,0);</pre>
<p>To create the SDK object, a reference to the scene descriptor is
passed to
the create method:</p>
<pre>	gScene = gPhysicsSDK-&gt;<span class="SpellE">createScene</span>(sceneDesc);<br>	if (!gScene) Error("Can't create scene!");<br></pre>
<p>NOTE: It is important that the user check the return values of all
create methods, because if the descriptor object contains illegal
parameters,
the creation will fail.</p>
<p>After you are finished using an object and want to get rid of it,
you must
destroy it. Once again, you may not use the standard C++ delete
operator. It
would lead to memory corruption. Instead, you must ask the object that
created
your instance to delete it for you. This is done using a method called
release*:</p>
<pre>	gPhysicsSDK-&gt;releaseScene(*gScene);<br>	gScene = 0;	//the object is now deleted,<br>			//so don't use the pointer anymore!<br>
</pre>
<p>After you release an object, do not use that pointer or reference
again.
While you may notice some similarities between this convention and
that of COM (as it is used in DirectX<sup>TM</sup>), there is an important
difference: The
up casting and down casting operators (described below) do not count as
a COM QueryInterface(),
so no release() needs to be called for them. In other words, here you
release
an object, and not a pointer. When calling release, the object pointed
to is
guaranteed to be deleted, and no reference counting is used.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you release an object which you have used to create other
objects, these other owned objects will be released
automatically. For example, if you release the SDK, all the created
scenes will
be released.</p>
<h2>Up Casting</h2>
<p>Up casting is the operation of converting a derived
class reference (or subclass) to a super class reference.</p>
<p>In versions of the SDK prior to 2.1.2 the SDK did not support
interface
inheritance and thus related classes did not form real hierarchies.
This is no
longer the case; it is possible to use the C++ built in inheritance
mechanism to
implicitly cast from subtypes to super types.</p>
<h2>Down Casting</h2>
<p>Down casting is the opposite of up casting. Here you are trying to
convert a
reference from a subclass to one of its potential derived classes.
Unlike up
casting, downcasts cannot be validated at compile time, so there is a
possibility that it will fail if called on the wrong type of object.
For
example, an NxShape reference pointing to an NxSphereShape object will
successfully cast to an NxSphereShape reference, but the cast will fail
when you
try to cast it to an NxBoxShape. The example below
shows the syntax of attempting downcasts in the SDK: </p>
<pre>   //this is still the sphere object created above.<br>   NxShape * shape = shapePointers[0];<br>                <br>   //get back the sphere pointer<br>   NxSphereShape * sphere = shape-&gt;isSphere();<br>                <br>   //try to get a box shape pointer:<br>   NxBoxShape * p = shape-&gt;isBox();<br>   //failure! here p will be set to 0.</pre>
<p>NOTE: A failed downcast is not an error as such, so no error is
reported
other than returning a NULL pointer. See the API reference regarding
the
specific class hierarchy, and which classes provide which up and
downcast
methods.<br>
