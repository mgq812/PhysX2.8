<h1 align="center">Saving the Simulation State</h1>

<p>Most of the simulation objects that are created using a descriptor have two
methods: saveToDesc() and loadFromDesc(). These methods are useful for
saving the simulation state, and then restoring it at a later time. In games,
this can be used for saving games and demo playback. To save the state, call
saveToDesc() on the object to save, and all the necessary state information
will be written into the descriptor. Be sure to check the API documentation of
saveToDesc() for the object at hand, because sometimes additional measures may
be needed. The user is then responsible for serializing the data contained in
the descriptor. This sometimes involves the conversion of pointers to an
equivalent persistent identifier.</p>

<p>Later, when the object is to be restored, you must deserialize the descriptor
data to its original state, and then either call loadFromDesc() on an existing
object, or, better yet, create a new object by passing the descriptor to the
create*() call.</p>

<p>Previous versions of the SDK provided explicit &quot;core dump&quot;
functionality. This has been superseded by enhanced support
for serialization. The same functionality is provided by the <a
href="tools_serialization.html">serialization class library</a>.</p>
