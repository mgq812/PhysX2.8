<h1 align="center">Batched Scene Queries</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SDK exposes the following <i>scene-level queries</i>, in <i>NxScene</i>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Raycast functions </li>
    <li>Sweep tests </li>
    <li>Overlap tests </li>
    <li>Culling tests</li>
</ul>

In version 2.7.0 a new <i>NxSceneQuery</i>
object was introduced to batch such queries together and
execute all of them at the same time, instead of one after the
other. Batched queries are usually faster than the individual
calls.

<h2>Creating / Releasing Scene Query Objects</h2>

The first step is to create an <i>NxSceneQuery</i>
object, using this function:

<pre>   virtual NxSceneQuery* NxScene::createSceneQuery(const NxSceneQueryDesc&amp;)</pre>

This object will store the batched queries,
manage them, etc. It will eventually replace all the
corresponding <i>NxScene</i> functions. When you are done with
the object, release it with the following function:

<pre>   virtual bool NxScene::releaseSceneQuery(NxSceneQuery&amp;)</pre>

The object is created via a descriptor containing the following elements:

<pre>NxSceneQueryReport* NxSceneQueryDesc::report;
NxSceneQueryExecuteMode NxSceneQueryDesc::executeMode;
</pre>

Those elements are explained in details in the following sections.

<h2>Queries</h2>
The scene queries that are available through the new batched interface are basically the same as the ones available directly through NxScene, with a few differences:
<ul>
    <li>The raycast functions against bounds are not supported anymore.</li>
    <li>Only the &#147;accurate mode&#148; is supported in overlap tests</li>
</ul>
Please refer to the original functions for details.

<h3>NxSceneQueryReport</h3>

This is a user-defined report object, called with query results. There are 4 different callbacks for 4 different kinds or results:

<pre>
virtual NxQueryReportResult&nbsp;&nbsp; onBooleanQuery(void* userData, bool result)

virtual NxQueryReportResult&nbsp;&nbsp; onRaycastQuery(void* userData, NxU32 nbHits, const NxRaycastHit* hits)

virtual NxQueryReportResult&nbsp;&nbsp; onShapeQuery(void* userData, NxU32 nbHits, NxShape** hits)

virtual NxQueryReportResult&nbsp;&nbsp; onSweepQuery(void* userData, NxU32 nbHits, NxSweepQueryHit* hits)
</pre>
Whenever a result is returned through those
callbacks, one can define what happens next, with an <i>NxQueryReportResult</i>
return value. It is possible to continue enumerating the results
for current query (NX_SQR_CONTINUE), stop enumerating the results
for current query (NX_SQR_ABORT_QUERY), or stop enumerating all
results for all batched queries (NX_SQR_ABORT_ALL_QUERIES).

<h3>NxSceneQueryExecuteMode</h3>
It is possible to execute the scene queries in two different modes: synchronous and asynchronous.

<p class="MsoNormal">In <i>synchronous</i> mode, queries are not
batched, but instead performed immediately. This is the same as
calling the old <i>NxScene</i> functions. Results are available
immediately, either through returned parameters, or through the
callback object.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In <i>asynchronous</i> mode, queries are
batched inside the query object. They are all performed at the
same time in a later stage, when the user calls the <i>NxSceneQuery::execute</i>
method. Results are then sent to the <i>NxSceneQueryReport</i>
object exclusively. When the queries are performed in a separate
thread, you can use the <i>NxSceneQuery::finish()</i> method to
check whether the work has been completed or not.</p>

<h2>Query Object Lifetime</h2>

<p>An <i>NxSceneQuery</i>
should be re-used for multiple queries over multiple frames. It
is not efficient to create a different object each time you
perform a raycast, for example.</p>

<p>For batched queries (asynchronous mode), keep in mind that all
queries and their parameters are saved inside the <i>NxSceneQuery</i>
object. This uses some memory. The memory is recycled for
subsequent batched queries, and only released when the <i>NxSceneQuery</i>
object is deleted.</p>
