<h1 style="text-align: center;">Soft Body Parameters</h1>
Soft body parameters may be specified during soft body creation, using
members of the NxSoftBodyDesc, or after creation using members of NxSoftBody.
Many of the soft body's properties have a similar, if not identical,
interpretation as their NxCloth / NxClothDesc counterpart.<br>


<h2>Flags</h2>
<pre>    NxSoftBodyDesc::flags</pre>
or<br>

<pre>    NxSoftBody::setFlags()</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The following flags may be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NX_SBF_STATIC - Makes the soft body static.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_DISABLE_COLLISION - Disable collision handling with the rigid
    body scene.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_SELFCOLLISION - Enable/disable self-collision handling within a single soft body.
    Self-collisions are only handled inbetween the soft body's particles, 
    i.e., particles do not collide against the tetrahedra of the soft body.
    The user should therefore specify a large enough particleRadius to avoid most interpenetrations. 
    See NxSoftBodyDesc.particleRadius.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_VISUALIZATION - Enable/disable debug visualization.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_GRAVITY - Enable/disable gravity. If off, the soft body is not
    subject to the gravitational force of the rigid body scene.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_VOLUME_CONSERVATION - Select volume conservation through
    NxSoftBodyDesc.volumeStiffness.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_DAMPING - Enable/disable damping of internal velocities. Use
    NxSoftBodyDesc.dampingCoefficient to control damping.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_COLLISION_TWOWAY - Enable/disable two way collision of the soft
    body with the rigid body scene. In either case, the soft body is
    influenced by colliding rigid bodies. If NX_SBF_COLLISION_TWOWAY is not
    set, rigid bodies are not influenced by colliding with the soft body. Use
    NxSoftBodyDesc.collisionResponseCoefficient to control the strength of
    the feedback force on rigid bodies.
    <p>When using two way interaction care should be taken when setting the
    density of the attached objects. For example if an object with a very low
    or high density is attached to a soft body then the simulation may behave
    poorly.</p>
    <p>This is because impulses are only transfered between the soft body and
    rigid body solver outside the solvers.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_TEARABLE - Defines whether the soft body is tearable. Make sure
    meshData.maxVertices and the corresponding buffers in meshData are
    substantially larger (e.g. 2x) than the number of original vertices since
    tearing will generate new vertices. When the buffer cannot hold the new
    vertices anymore, tearing stops. If this buffer is chosen big enough, the
    entire mesh can be torn into all constituent tetrahedral elements. (The
    theoretical maximum needed is 12 times the original number of vertices.
    For reasonable mesh topologies, this should never be reached though.)
    <p>If the soft body is simulated on the hardware, additional buffer
    limitations that cannot be controlled by the user exist. Therefore, soft
    bodies might cease to tear apart further, even though not all space in
    the user buffer is used up.</p>
    <p>Note: For tearing in hardware, make sure you cook the mesh with the
    flag NX_SOFTBODY_MESH_TEARABLE set in the NxSoftBodyMeshDesc.flags.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_HARDWARE - Defines whether this soft body is simulated on the
    PPU. To simulate a soft body on the PPU set this flag and create the soft
    body in a regular software scene.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_COMDAMPING - Enable/disable center of mass damping of internal
    velocities. This flag only has an effect if the flag NX_SBF_DAMPING is
    set. If set, the global rigid body modes (translation and rotation) are
    extracted from damping. This way, the soft body can freely move and
    rotate even under high damping. Use NxSoftBodyDesc.dampingCoefficient to
    control damping.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>NX_SBF_VALIDBOUNDS - Enable valid bounds for this cloth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Volume And Stretching Stiffness</h2>
<pre>NxSoftBodyDesc::volumeStiffness</pre>

<p>or<br>
</p>
<pre>NxSoftBody::setVolumeStiffness()</pre>

<p></p>
<pre>NxSoftBodyDesc::stretchingStiffness</pre>

<p>or<br>
</p>
<pre>NxSoftBody::setStretchingStiffness()</pre>

<p>Volume and stretching stiffnesses are used the specify how strongly the
soft body responds to deviations from the rest state given by the input mesh.
The soft body simulation manipulates the vertex positions to counteract
deformations that change the volume and edge lengths of each tetrahedral
element.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="softbody_constraints.png" src="images/softbody_constraints.png"
/>
 <br>
</p>

<p>The stiffnesses of both constraint types can be set independently to a
number in the range 0 to 1, similar to the bending and stretching stiffness
values in the cloth simulation. The following combinations are typical:</p>

<table border="1">
  <caption></caption>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>low volume stiffness</td>
      <td>high volume stiffness</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>low stretching stiffness</td>
      <td>The soft body vertices act as independently of each other as
        possible.</td>
      <td>The soft body shape may now deviate strongly from the original
        configuration, but the preserved overall volume will still retain the
        original size.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>high stretching stiffness</td>
      <td>Only edge lengths are preserved. The simulation may still behave
        similarly as if a high volume stiffness were given. However, heavy
        deformations may cause tetrahedral elements to be inverted to their
        mirror image, causing the soft body to be trapped in an entangled
        state (from which it can usually recover though, once the volume
        stiffness is increased again).</td>
      <td>The simulation maintains the original mesh configuration as closely
        as possible.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p></p>

<p>Note that even if the stretching stiffness is set very low, tetrahedron
edges will cease to stretch further if their length exceeds a certain
internal limit. This is done to prevent heavily degenerated tetrahedral
elements which could occur if the vertices could move totally independent of
each other.</p>

<p>Volume stiffness only has an effect if NX_SBF_VOLUME_CONSERVATION is
set.</p>

<h2>Density</h2>
<pre>NxSoftBodyDesc::density</pre>
NOTE: Density can only be specified when creating a soft body.<br>
<br>
Density indirectly specifies the mass of the soft body particles. The mass of
a particle is calculated as the sum of the following equation (for tetrahedra
sharing a point):<br>
<br>
1/4 * tetrahedronVolume * density<br>
<br>


<h2>Particle Radius</h2>
<pre>NxSoftBodyDesc::particleRadius</pre>
or<br>

<pre>NxSoftBody::setParticleRadius()</pre>
The particle radius specifies the radius of the particle's surrounding sphere
used during collision detection, improving its robustness. Setting it very
low is not recommended as this will lead to poor collision handling. This
parameter is the soft body's analogue to the thickness parameter of the cloth.
