<h1 align="center">Character Controller</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">The
goal of the character controller SDK&nbsp;is to provide  a
default built on top of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK. Roughly it has to
support the following: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div class="MsoNormal">Character control</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="MsoNormal">Character
interactions</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This
covers a very high number of features, which can be implemented in
numerous ways. The goal is <i style=""> not</i> to implement all of
them (which would be a daunting task), but to offer a
default implementation that people can use as a starting point.
For example, the character's bounding volume could  be
anything, from a box to an inverted pyramid; therefore, in our initial
implementation we support two common bounding volumes: an AABB and a
capsule.</p>
<p>One
might wonder why we didn't use the physics engine directly to implement
the character controller. Here is the story.</p>
<h2>Implementation Decisions</h2>
<p>
In the past, games didn't use &quot;real&quot; physics engines.
However, they still used a character controller to move a player in a
level. These games, such as <i style="">Quake</i> or even <i style="">Doom</i>,
had a dedicated, customized piece of code to implement <i style="">collision
detection and response</i>, which was often the only piece of physics
in the whole game. It actually had little physics, but a lot of
carefully tweaked values to provide a good <i style="">feeling</i>
while controlling the player. The particular behavior it implemented is
often called the &quot; <i style="">collide and slide&quot;</i> algorithm, and it
has been tweaked for more than a decade. The result is that players
expect to find the same well-known behavior in new games, and providing
them with anything else is often dangerous (a few games come to mind
but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s appropriate to name them). This is especially
true if provided behavior is not as robust and stable as before, which is exactly what happens if you use a typical physics engine
directly to control players. 
<p>In particular, here is a (non-exhaustive) list
of typical problems when using a physics engine for
character controllers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>(Lack Of) Continuous Collision Detection:</strong> Typical
physics engines use discrete collision checks, leading to the famous
tunneling effect that has plagued various commercial &amp;
non-commercial physics packages for years, which leads to three main problems: 
<ul><br>
  <li>The tunneling effect itself - if the character goes too fast, it might tunnel through a wall.</li>
  <li>As a consequence, the
        maximum velocity of the character might be limited (hence also
      limiting the game-play possibilities).</li>
  <li>Even without tunnel,
            the character might jitter when pushed forward in a corner. For example,
             the engine keeps moving it back and forth to slightly different
      positions.  </li><br><br>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>No Direct Control:</strong> A rigid
body is typically controlled with impulses or forces. It is
nearly impossible to move it directly to its final position until you have converted the delta position vector to impulses or forces and applied them in
hopes that the character will be where you wanted it to be as a result.
Usually it doesn't work very well, in particular when the physics engine
uses an imperfect linear solver.  </li><br><br>
  <li>
    <strong>Trouble with
Friction:</strong> When the character is standing on a ramp, you
don't want it to slide. Infinite friction is desired. When the character is moving
forward <i style="">on that same ramp</i>, or sliding against a wall, you don't want it to slow
down, thus a null friction is needed. These are usually defined with either 0 or infinite. However, the
friction model might not be perfect, and what you actually get is very little friction, so you can still feel the character slowing down, or
a high-but-not-infinite friction, so the character slides very slowly on
that ramp no matter how artificially high the friction parameters
are.&nbsp;The
conflicting requirements for ramps  mean that usually there is
simply no way to perfectly model desired behavior.
  </li><br><br>
  <li>
    <strong>Trouble with Restitution: </strong>Basically you don't want any
restitution, ever. When the character moves fast and collides with a
wall, you don't want it to bump against it. When the character falls
from a height and lands on the ground, flexing his legs, you definitely
don't want any bumps, which would visually look terrible. But
once again, even when the restitution is exactly zero, you sometimes get
a small bump nonetheless. This is not only related to the non-perfect
nature of the linear solver, but also has to do with how typical
penetration-depth-based engines recover from overlap situations,
sometimes applying too high a force that repels objects more than desired.  </li><br>
  <br><li>
    <strong>Undesired Jumps: </strong>It is often important that  a character stick to the
ground, no matter what the physical behavior should be. For example,
characters in action games tend to move fast, at unrealistic speeds.
When they reach the top of a ramp, the physics engine often makes them
jump a bit, in the same way a fast car would jump in the streets of San
Francisco. But that is often not desired: the character
should stick to the ground regardless of its current velocity. This is
sometimes implemented using fixed joints, which is  a terrible,
terrible solution to a very simple problem that has been solved for
years without requiring all the modern complexity of a physics engine.  </li><br><br>
  <li>
    
    <strong>Undesired Rotations: </strong>Finally, a character is
always standing up and never rotating. However, a physics engine often
has poor support for that kind of constraint, and a great deal of
effort is  put into just preventing a capsule around the character
from falling (it should always stand up on its tip). This too is sometimes implemented using artificial joints, and the resulting system is
neither very robust nor very fast.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a lot of time is spent in disabling
the physics engine's features, one after the other, for the whole
purpose of emulating an otherwise simple piece of customized code. This
is  not the correct approach.</p>
