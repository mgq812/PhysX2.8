<h1 style="text-align: center;">Collision Detection</h1>
<p>Many dynamic applications  are not concerned with the
forces that occur when bodies collide or touch (e.g., a rocket taking off, or a cannon ball flying in an arc
due to gravity). On the other hand, most interesting applications are concerned with collision detection - for the cannon ball to bounce on the ground or an articulated body to
fall down stairs, the SDK must be provided with the shapes of the
bodies that can touch, and also the properties of the surfaces (e.g., how slippery they are). This collision detection functionality
can range from very simple (the cannon ball is simply dependent on whether the ball is above or below ground level) to
quite complex (in the case of the articulated body falling down the
stairs). A body falling down the stairs is more complex because it involves many shapes intersecting. For example, the SDK may need to collide a convex against a mesh, and must resolve the system in a way to maintain the constraints within the body. </p>
<h2>Shapes</h2>
<p>The SDK lets you create shapes - these are objects which occupy a
well-defined volume in space. The Dynamics section served as an introduction on how several shapes are
attached to an actor's frame of reference.</p>
<p>The easiest way to create shapes is together with the actor that
owns them. For example, the below code creates a mace shaped actor made
up of a spherical head and a round handle:</p>
<pre>    NxSphereShapeDesc head;<br>    NxCapsuleShapeDesc handle;<br>    NxActorDesc desc;<br>    NxBodyDesc bodyDesc;</pre>
<pre>    /*Implicitly define the mace's origin to be near the lower<br>    end of its handle, where a character would grip to hold it.*/</pre>
<pre>    head.radius = 0.05f;//Mace head has radius of 5cm.<br>    head. localPose.t.set(0,45,0); //Head's position relative to the mace's origin.</pre>
<pre>    handle.radius = 0.01f; //Handle has a radius of 1 cm.<br>    handle.height = 0.50f; //Handle is 50 cm long along its y axis.<br>   &nbsp;handle.localPose.t.set(0,15,0); //Handle's position relative to the mace's origin.</pre>
<pre>    /*Set the position of the mace in the world here. This would have to be the pose of a <br>    character's hand in world space.*/</pre>
<pre>    desc. globalPose = myPose. <br>    desc. body = &amp;bodyDesc; //Set dynamics properties here.<br><br>    desc.density = 7600; //This is the density of iron in kg/m3.<br><br>    //Assign the shapes to the actor:<br>   &nbsp;desc.shapes.pushBack(&amp;head);<br>   &nbsp;desc.shapes.pushBack(&amp;handle);</pre>
<pre>    //Create the actor:<br><br>    scene-&gt;createActor(desc);</pre>
<p>
The localPose set above can also be accessed and changed
using the NxShape::setLocalPose(), etc., methods.</p>
