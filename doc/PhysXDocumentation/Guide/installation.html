<h1 align="center">Installation</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>After downloading the NVIDIA PhysX
SDK installer executable from the NVIDIA web site, follow the directions
of the
installer program. When complete, the directory structure described
below will be created in the location you have specified.</p>
<h2>Directory Structure</h2>
<p>The SDK installer creates the
following directory structure:
<table
 style="text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 214px; width: 982px;"
 border="1">
  <caption> <br>
  </caption> <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <div style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Directory</strong></div>
      </td>
      <td>
      <div style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Description</strong></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(SDK Path)\Samples</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Include files for the character SDK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Include file for the loader library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Library files for each component of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>There may be various other directories containing stand alone demos,
demo scenes, and tools.</p>
<h2>Components Overview</h2>
<p>The SDK is divided into the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physics SDK - used to simulate rigid bodies, fluids, etc.</li>
  <li>Cooking SDK - allows meshes to be preprocessed into a form
suitable for use with the physics SDK.</li>
  <li>Foundation SDK - a library of container, math and utility classes
for use by the other SDKs.</li>
  <li>Character SDK - provides tools to simulate a game character.</li>
  <li>PhysXLoader - used to dynamically load the appropriate core
physics SDK. The loader locates the correct DLL (taking into account
version number, installation location, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The core NVIDIA PhysX files (PhysXCore.dll, NxCooking.dll and the firmware binaries)
are no longer intended for distribution within a game installer.
Instead, a dedicated installer for developers to execute as part of the
install process is provided. The installer will install the software
runtime files and, if necessary, the NVIDIA PhysX hardware drivers.<br>
<br>
Command line options:</p>
<p>PhysXInstaller_x.x.x.exe [/semiSilent] [/noLanguageSilent]
[/noXFIRE] [/noSysTray] [/noHwDriver]</p>
<ul>
  <li>/semiSilent
- will not show the
installation options page, only the language selection, license
agreement page, and install files page</font></li>
  <li>/noLanguageSilent - will not show the
installation options page, only the license agreement page and install
files page</li>
  <li>/noXFIRE - will not install the XFIRE
client (this will uncheck the option)</li>
  <li>/noSysTray - will not autostart the
PhysX system tray icon (this will uncheck the option)</li>
  <li>/noHwDriver - will not install the NVIDIA PhysX
Processor Device Driver (this will uncheck the option)</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: This is not a completely silent PhysX installation due to the
EULA agreement that the end user must check.</p>
<h2>Compiler Setup</h2>
<p>The example programs are supplied with project files for Microsoft
Visual Studio VC++ 7 and 8 (Solution files). You will be able to open
the files provided and issue a build command without additional
configuration; however, the created example programs will need to
access the SDK DLLs, which are located in the /BIN/win32 directory
(this includes PhysXLoader.dll and NxCharacter.dll).</p>
<p>If you are using a compiler other than VC++ 7 or 8, or if you would like
to create a new project using the SDK, set it up as follows:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Specify the '<em>SDKs\Foundation\include</em>', '<em>SDKs\Physics\include</em>',
and '<em>SDKs\PhysXLoader\include</em>' as directories in which include
files are located.</li>
  <li>Identify the <em>PhysXLoader.lib</em> file in '<em>SDKs\lib\win32\</em>'
as a library to the linker.</li>
  <li>Additionally, you may need to specify '<em>SDKs\Cooking\include</em>'
	and '<em>SDKs\NxCharacter\include</em>' plus its corresponding .lib file
	if you use features from these libraries.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have created an executable, make sure PhysXLoader.dll is
available somewhere in the windows DLL search path (see the MSDN
documentation entry, "LoadLibrary", for details). The easiest way to
achieve this is to have the compiler write the produced executable into
the /BIN/win32 directory.</p>
<p>An important compiler setting to take note of is the (reserved) stack size, you should ensure that this is sufficient to accommodate the scenes which you will be simulating. As a rough guideline, it should be proportional to the number of actors, number of joints in a chain and the complexity of your mesh objects. Plus a larger stack size is required in debug versus release mode. As an example 1Mb should be sufficient for about 1000 actors in a jointed chain in debug mode. </p>
<p>In addition, the NVIDIA PhysX driver installer must have been used to
install the correct software/hardware drivers.</p>
