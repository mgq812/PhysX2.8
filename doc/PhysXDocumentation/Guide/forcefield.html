<h1 align="center">Force Fields</h1>

<p>For rigid body and cloth simulations, forces can be applied to individual objects (or points in a cloth), but they 
require calls to the API for every object at every time-step.  For simulations running on the PPU, this is particularly 
inefficient.</p>
<p>To remedy this, you can use <i>force fields</i>. These are SDK objects akin to actors, which affect cloth, soft bodies, fluid and rigid
bodies that enter their area of influence. Force fields allow you to implement for example gusts of wind, dust devils, vacuum
cleaners or anti-gravity zones.</p>
<p>Force fields possess two important geometrical properties: their volume of activity, which is defined by groups of shapes
(similar to actors), and the <i>force field kernel</i> function, which defines the strength of the field throughout the volume of activity. 
One can chose between the <i>linear kernel</i> which is corresponding to the 2.7.2 force field function or one can create its own 
<i>custom kernel</i> from a set of basic operations.</p>
