<h1 style="text-align: center;">Soft Bodies</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The soft body feature of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK allows the simulation of
volumetric deformable objects. It can also be used for items that are not
usually thought of as classical soft bodies, such as plants or multiple
layers of cloth. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tires of a monster truck</li>
  <li>Big fat guys, monsters</li>
  <li>Curvy girls</li>
  <li>Objects with complex geometry such as trees, grass</li>
</ul>

<p>To simulate complex geometry like a tree with many branches and leaves, a
coarser volumetric mesh is first build around the object. The volumetric mesh
is then simulated and moves the complex geometry with it (see <a
href="softbody_rendering.html">soft body rendering</a>). The advantage of the
technique is that it makes the simulation of triangle soups possible, i.e.
every possible mesh can be simulated.</p>

<p>The soft body feature is very similar to the cloth feature. Therefore, the
two features have similar parameters and methods. Here are the main
differences</p>

      <td>A soft body is a volume</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The triangle mesh is used for simulation <strong>and</strong>
        visualization</td>
      <td>The tetrahedral mesh is used for simulation
      <strong>only</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The artists triangle mesh can be used directly</td>
      <td>A tetrahedral mesh has to be generated for the triangle mesh</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Content Pipeline</h2>

<p>The content pipeline for soft bodies has some additional stages to the
cloth pipeline.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The artist creates a detailed triangle mesh, possibly with textures,
    bump maps etc.</li>
  <li>A tool is used to create a coarser tetrahedral mesh around the triangle
    mesh. (We provide tools for this purpose, which are illustrated in the
    PhysXViewer sample application)</li>
  <li>The tetrahedral mesh is simulated using the NxSoftBody and
    NxSoftBodyMesh classes.</li>
  <li>The original triangle mesh is deformed along with the tetrahedral mesh
    by the user.</li>
  <li>The triangle mesh is displayed on the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following images show a tetrahedral mesh (middle, right) that was
generated for a triangle mesh (left). The right most cut through the
tetrahedral mesh shows that it covers the volume.</p>

</p>

<p></p>

<p>The process works for arbitrary triangle soups like the palm tree. The
image on the right shows how the original triangle soup is embedded in the
tetrahedral mesh which is shown in wireframe mode.</p>

</p>

<p></p>

<p>The resolution of the tetrahedral mesh can be chosen independently of the
resolution of the triangle mesh. This allows for choosing a level of detail
for the simulation without losing visual resolution. The following images
show different resolutions of a palm tree mesh. With the coarser meshes,
independent movement of individual leaves is not possible. To get this
dynamic feature, more tetrahedra are needed as shown on the right:</p>
