<h1 align="center">Static Actors</h1>
<p>Static actors  do not have any of the dynamic
properties discussed in the Rigid Body Properties section. Create a static actor by setting the
body member to NULL in the actor descriptor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the static actor is created,  do not do anything with
it. Even though operations such as changing the position, adding more
shapes, or even deleting the static actor are not explicitly forbidden,
they are not recommended for two reasons: 1) the SDK assumes that
static actors are indeed static, and does all sorts of optimizations
that rely on this property. Changing the static actor may force time
consuming re-computation of such data structures, and 2) the code
driving dynamic actors and joints is written with the assumption
that static actors will not move or be deleted for the duration of the
simulation, which permits a number of optimizations for this very
common scenario. For example, moving a static actor out from under a
stack of sleeping boxes will not wake these up, thus they will levitate
in midair. Even if they are woken up, the collision response between
moving static and dynamic actors is of low quality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To achieve the behaviors of movable static actors, use 'kinematic' actors.
Read about them in the <a href="dynamics_actors_kinematic.html">Kinematic Actors</a> section.</p>
