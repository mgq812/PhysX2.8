<h1 align="center">Character
Controller - Update</h1>

<p>In each frame, characters can be moved using the following function: 
<pre class="MsoNormal">
   NxController::move(constNxVec3&amp; disp, NxU32 activeGroups, NxF32 minDist, NxU32&amp; collisionFlags, 
                      NxF32 sharpness=1.0f, const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL);</pre>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>disp</strong> is the displacement vector for the current frame. It is
typically a combination of a vertical motion due to gravity and a
lateral motion when your character is moving. Note that this is a
displacement vector, i.e., a first order control. This is not an impulse
 (second order control) or a force (third order
control) vector.  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>activeGroups</strong> is a bit mask
representing active collision groups, i.e., groups that should be
included in the collision tests.  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>minDist</strong> is a
minimal length used to stop the recursive displacement algorithm early
when remaining distance to travel goes below this limit.  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>collisionFlags</strong>
is a bit mask returned to users to define collision events that
happened during the move. This is a combination of <em>NxControllerFlag</em>
flags. It can be used to trigger various character animations. For
example, your character might be falling while playing a falling idle
animation, and you might start the land animation as soon as <em>NXCC_COLLISION_DOWN</em> is returned.  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>sharpness</strong>
is used to smooth  motion with a feedback filter, having a value between 0 (so smooth it doesn't move) and 1 (no
smoothing = unfiltered motion). Sharpness can ease the motion curve when the auto-step feature is used with
boxes. Not needed with the capsule controller.  </li>
<li>
<strong>groupsMask</strong>
is used when you want to temporarily use an alternative mask for filtering the shapes that the controller can collide with, see NxScene::overlapAABBShapes().
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Graphics Update</h2>
<p>In each frame, keep the graphics object in sync
with the position of the character controller. A controller never
rotates so only its position can be accessed, using the following code:</p>

<pre class="MsoNormal">   const NxVec3&amp; NxController::getPosition()<span>const</span>;</pre>

<p>If you  use this
position in your world matrix and pass this to the renderer, the
character should collide and slide smoothly against the world.</p>
