<h1 align="center">Modeling with Joints</h1>
<p></p>
<p>When  considering an appropriate joint from which to model a real world
machine, making an exact copy may be possible, but is almost never the optimal choice. This is because
engineers who design real world objects have constraints you do not
have within a simulation. For example, shock absorber elements in the
real world cannot go through the wheel which they support - for this
reason the engineer has to use additional
joints to lead the suspension mechanism around the wheel. In a
virtual simulation, this is not a consideration. </p>
<p>Also in the real world,
  an asymmetric construction may be impractical because it
  might lead to added friction or less stability. In the simulation, you don't
  have friction unless you purposely create it. Similarly, a real world car
  that has twice as many shock absorbers as another will not necessarily
  be slower, but your simulation of it will. </p>
<p>Consider the picture below of
  a real world car suspension assembly versus a virtual approximation.
  They are quite different. The real thing looks much more
  "realistic". For this reason, it may be useful to create
  the real assembly as a graphical prop, displayed and animated in place of the simplified dynamics scheme
  that you use for the actual simulation.</p>

<p>The figure shows a real mechanical component (single wheel
suspension of a car) made up of a large number of joints, and an
alternative simpler scheme with about the same degrees of freedom.</p>
