<h1 style="text-align: center;">Extended Scene Stats</h1>

<p>For purposes of both optimizing performance and troubleshooting physics artifacts, PhysX version 2.6.1 adds an extended
scene statistic API with a large amount of data that can be extracted from a scene in order to ascertain what it is
doing beneath the hood.</p>
<p>The information is stored in the NxSceneStats2 class. Using the NxScene::getStats2, you can access the statistics for the
last simulated frame in the scene. You may either process this data on a frame-per-frame basis, or extract pertinent subsets
of the data and store it for later inspection.<br />
Note that if you wish to store the data each frame, you will need to copy it out of the NxSceneStats2 structure yourself,
as it refers to an internal data structure which is overwritten during each simulation step.</p>
<p>The data items consist of simple counters, enumerating important numerical quantities of the scene, including e.g. different
categories of shapes as well as certain warnings that may arise when, for example, internal limits are exceeded. The maximum 
value of each counter over the lifetime of the scene is also kept on record.<br />
Furthermore, some counters are considered subordinate to others; this hierarchy can help in sorting and filtering data items.
A counter will not exceed the count of its parent (but the total of the parent's children may).</p>
<p>Here follows a list of the current set of scene stat counters. Note, however, that items may be added to this list
in the future, and that its contents are not considered part of the API (though its contents are guaranteed to remain 
the same while a program is running).</p>
