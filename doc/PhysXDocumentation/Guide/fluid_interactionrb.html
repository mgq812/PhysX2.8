<h1 align="center">Fluid Interaction with Rigid Bodies </h1>
<h2>Rigid bodies acting on particles</h2>
<p>When a particle collides with a rigid body,  a
collision impulse is applied to the particle.
By default, collisions with static and dynamic shapes are both
considered. To enable them separately, the user can specify the
NX_F_STATIC and the NX_F_DYNAMIC flags in the
NxFluidDesc::collisionMethod member; this can also be adjusted
during simulation using NxFluid::setCollisionMethod.<br>
<br>
The fluid's API allows a coefficient of restitution to be defined for
collisions with static and dynamic shapes separately. These are
specified using NxFluidDesc::restitutionForDynamicShapes and
NxFluidDesc::restitutionForStaticShapes. Intuitively, these
parameters define how much the particles bounce when they collide
with shapes. The restitution coefficients must be between 0 and
1. A value of 0 keeps particles from bouncing and removes all
their momentum in the direction of the contact normal. A value of 1
causes the particles to be reflected without any loss of momentum.<br>
<br>
In addition, a friction (adhesion) factor can be defined which controls
how easily particles slide along a surface. A value of 1 causes a
particle to lose all its momentum tangential to the surface so that it sticks to the surface, while a value of 0 allows the particle
to keep its momentum and thus slide. To visualize, imagine a
viscous blob of liquid sliding smoothly across polished steel
(a low friction factor) and 
more slowly down a slab of sandstone (a higher friction factor). The
friction factors can be set using NxFluidDesc::dynamicFrictionForDynamicShapes
and NxFluidDesc::dynamicFrictionForStaticShapes. Static friction thresholds (also called stiction)
(NxFluidDesc::staticFrictionForDynamicShapes and (NxFluidDesc::staticFrictionForStaticShapes)
are defined in the API but are not implemented yet. The same holds for normal direction attraction 
to the shape surface: (NxFluidDesc::attractionForDynamicShapes, NxFluidDesc::attractionForStaticShapes).<br>
<br>
The distance that fluid particles maintain from the surface of rigid bodies
can be adjusted using NxFluidDesc::collisionDistanceMultiplier. This
is a multiplier, and the actual rest distance is the product of this number
and the inverse of restParticlesPerMeter.
<br>

<br>
Fluids contacting meshes (i.e. triangle meshes, heightfields or convexes) require special
processing of the triangles for fluid collision. Instead of relying on the SDK performing
these calculations automatically, you can pre-cook areas you know will contact fluids
using the NxScene::cookFluidMeshHotspot method. This way you can avoid performance spikes.
Please see <a href="hardware_hsm_fluid.html">compartments</a> for a list of limitations 
regarding the collision between rigid bodies and fluid particles.
<h2>Two-Way Interaction</h2>
It is possible to allow fluids to influence rigid bodies as they are
introduced. See <a href="hardware_hsm_fluid.html">compartments</a> for more information. <br>
Note that different fluids can <i>not</i>, at present, interact directly with each other.<br>
<h2>Attaching an Emitter to a Shape</h2>
Attaching an emitter to a shape is simply a case of setting the
NxEmitterDesc::frameShape to the appropriate rigid body shape. The
relPose transform is then used to position the emitter relative to the
shape's frame so that it will move and rotate along with the
actor.<br>
<br>
The user may want the particles created by the
emitter to have a velocity that is the sum of the emission velocity
and the emitter velocity  (which is attached to a dynamic actor).
This can be
achieved by setting the NX_FEF_ADD_BODY_VELOCITY flag in
NxEmitterDesc::flags.<br>
