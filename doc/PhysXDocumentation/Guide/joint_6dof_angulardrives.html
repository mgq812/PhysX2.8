<h1 style="text-align: center;">Angular Drives</h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Angular drive differs from linear drive in a
fundamental way: it does not have a simple and
intuitive representation free from singularities. For this reason, the d6joint provides two
angular drive models - twist and swing and SLERP (Spherical Linear
Interpolation).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Twist and swing is intuitive in many
situations; however, there is a singularity when driven to 180
degrees swing. In addition, the drive will not follow the shortest arc
between two orientations. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On the other hand, SLERP drive will follow the
shortest arc between a pair of angular configurations, but may cause
un-intuitive changes in the joint's twist and swing.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The d6joint angular drive takes a quaternion as
a target orientation. In a SLERP drive, the quaternion
is used directly. In a twist and swing drive, it is
decomposed into separate twist and swing components and each component
is interpolated separately.</p>
<h2>Angular Drive Model</h2>
The angular drive model for the d6joint
consists
of the following parameters:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Velocity targets are specified in relation to the parent
actor's (actor[0]) frame using
the following members of NxD6JointDesc:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>driveOrientation <strong>-</strong> a quaternion representing a relative orientation. </li>
      <li>driveAngularVelocity <strong>-</strong> a
vector representing the target velocity as a scaled axis.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Separate drive descriptors for SLERP (slerpDrive), swing (swingDrive) and twist (twistDrive) can be specified using these NxJointDriveDesc members:
    <ul>
      <li>driveType - used
        to apply a type of drive with the following flags: <br>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-style: italic;">NX_D6JOINT_DRIVE_POSITION
                - Enable drive to a goal orientation.<br>
            </span></li>
              <li><span style="font-style: italic;">NX_D6JOINT_DRIVE_VELOCITY
          - Enable drive to a velocity goal</span>.<br>
		  
              </span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>spring <strong>-</strong> amount of torque needed to move the   joint to its target orientation proportional to the angle from the target (not   used for a velocity drive).<br>
      </li>
      <li>damping <strong>-</strong> applied to the drive spring
(used to smooth out oscillations about the drive target).<br>
      </li>
      <li>forceLimit <strong>-</strong> maximum torque applied when driving towards a velocity target (not used
for an orientation drive).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Angular orientation drive will attempt to follow
the desired orientation input with the configured stiffness and damping
properties, while the joint constraints are enforced by
the solver. Ideally, the inputs should be consistent with the joint
constraints, requiring more effort compared to the linear case.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The default drive behavior for the angular DOFs
interpolates between orientations with decoupled twist and swing
freedoms, using separate drive properties for twist and swing (both
swing DOFs use the same drive properties). In fact, twist and swing is
the only drive method for 1DOF or 2DOF angular joints when one or
two angular DOFs are locked.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Instead of using the default twist and swing drive, 3DOF angular joints (i.e., no angular DOFs
locked) with orientation drive can utilize the SLERP option that interpolates between orientations
via a SLERP/shortest arc rotation.</p>
<h2>1DOF Angular Drive</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A joint with a single angular DOF, i.e. a hinge
or rotary joint, is similar to the equivalent linear 1DOF joint. The
obvious coordinate in this case is the joint angle but here it must be
input in quaternion form. The velocity input is the single angular
velocity component for the selected DOF.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It is recommended that revolute joints are
implemented as twist hinges because the d6joint is optimized for this
case and provides slightly more flexible limit functionality. In other words, the
user can specify a low and high angle separately, similar to
the dedicated revolute joint.</p>
<pre>    d6Desc.twistMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br>    d6Desc.swing1Motion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_LOCKED;<br>    d6Desc.swing2Motion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_LOCKED;<br><br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.driveType=NX_D6JOINT_DRIVE_POSITION;<br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.forceLimit=0.0f;<br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.spring=250.0f;<br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.damping=0.01f;<br><br>    ...<br><br>    joint-&gt;setDriveOrientation(NxQuat(angle,NxVec3(1.0f,0.0f,0.0f)); //Angle in degrees.<br></pre>
<h2>2DOF Angular Drives</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There are two types of joints with two angular
DOFs: the zero-twist joint and the zero-swing joint.</p>
<h3>zero-twist joint drive (aka Iso-Universal)</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The two swing DOFs remain to be actuated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The swing orientation is extracted from the input
quaternion by decomposing it into twist and swing as shown at the end
of this document, or it can be computed and input directly as shown
here:</p>
<pre>Qswing = Qyz = (Cyz, 0, Sy, Sz)</pre>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Velocity inputs, if required, can be derived
using the cross product to find the axis of rotation from the current
twist-axis swing direction to its desired swing direction, as demonstrated below:</p>
<pre>    d6Desc.twistMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_LOCKED;<br>    d6Desc.swing1Motion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br>    d6Desc.swing2Motion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br><br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.driveType=NX_D6JOINT_DRIVE_POSITION;<br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.forceLimit=0.0f;<br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.spring=250.0f;<br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.damping=0.01f;<br><br>    ...<br><br>    joint-&gt;setDriveOrientation(targetOrient);</pre>
<h3>zero-swing joint drive (aka Universal)</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The 2DOFs are a pair of sequential rotations
about orthogonal axes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The zero-swing1 joint DOFs are rotations about the child x-axis
and the parent z-axis. </li>
  <li> The zero-swing2 joint DOFs are rotations about the
child x-axis and the parent y-axis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The joint constraint keeps the two rotation axes
orthogonal.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The input quaternion is computed by composing
the two rotations (e.g., for the zero-swing2 joint):</p>
<pre>QyQx = (Cy, 0, Sy, 0)(Cx, Sx, 0, 0) = (CyCx, CySx, SyCx, -SySx)</pre>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The angular velocity input vector is found by
adding two rotation-axis-aligned angular velocity vectors as shown below: </p>
<pre>    d6Desc.twistMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br>    d6Desc.swing1Motion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_LOCKED;<br>    d6Desc.swing2Motion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br><br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.driveType=NX_D6JOINT_DRIVE_POSITION;<br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.forceLimit=0.0f;<br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.spring=250.0f;<br>    d6Desc.twistDrive.damping=0.01f;<br><br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.driveType=NX_D6JOINT_DRIVE_POSITION;<br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.forceLimit=0.0f;<br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.spring=250.0f;<br>    d6Desc.swingDrive.damping=0.01f;<br><br>    ...<br><br>    joint-&gt;setDriveOrientation(targetOrient);</pre>
<h2>3DOF Angular Drives</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The non-integrable ('nonholonomic') behavior
manifests itself in joints with 3DOF (i.e., none of the angular DOFs are
locked).</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Pure angular velocity drive is useless for
actuating the orientation of a body in the full 3DOFs as the
orientation will quickly drift away from what might be expected.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For an orientation drive, there is a choice between the default twist and swing drive or the optional SLERP drive.</p>
<h3>twist and swing drive</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Internally, the angular drive defaults to using
twist and swing coordinates. This is the preferred choice for all
joints within a skeletal character because it gives
the expected
interpolation behavior, decoupling twist and swing freedoms. However,
many animation systems deal with quaternions and perform SLERPs or
LERPs between the quaternions representing individual key frames. In
these systems, the SLERP drive may be the preferred system as it most
closely mimics the interpolation used in the key framing system.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Another case where the twist and swing drive may
prove useful is with AI controlled objects, such as gun turrents, where
the natural parameterization of the joint is a twist and a swing.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The twist and swing drive acts on the absolute
coordinates between parent frame and child frame, attempting to bring
these coordinates to the desired values between parent frame and drive
frame.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Because it acts on absolute coordinates, the
child frame should not be driven near the twist and swing singularity
at a full 180 degree swing.</p>
<h3>SLERP drive</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The d6joint angular drive has a SLERP option
to replace the default drive. The SLERP option decouples twist and swing
coordinates with an isotropic drive of all three angular DOFs. This
uses rotation vector coordinates in which a rotation vector lies in the single shortest rotation axis so the 3D
rotation isn't being decomposed into a sequence of rotations as with
twist and swing.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The SLERP drive acts locally between the drive
frame and the child frame. The parent frame is not directly involved in
the drive behavior; it only acts as a root from which to specify the
drive frame offset.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Because it acts locally, the SLERP option is
useful when the child object can rotate to any arbitrary orientation
relative to the parent without limit.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There is a singularity that could cause the
child to get stuck if its frame is 180 degrees away from the drive frame,
but this is unlikely to occur  (and will correct itself with
any small disturbance).
