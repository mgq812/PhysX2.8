<p class="MsoNormal">There are two basic ways to
create vehicles with the PhysX SDK:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0cm;" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Spherical
wheel bodies using joints to attach them to a rigid body representing
the chassis, eventually adding more rigid bodies that represent the
pieces of the steering and suspension geometry. The
advantage of this approach are the complex
steering and suspension geometries. The
disadvantages are a lack of a sophisticated tire friction model, and
that simulating several rigid bodies and joints can be costly and
inaccurate (joint error).</li><br><br>
  <li class="MsoNormal"> Raycast cars composed of a single rigid body with special ground contacts
that simulate the behavior of a wheel. The
wheels themselves are not modeled as separate rigid bodies, which makes
for a much more lightweight simulation, and no joint error. The disadvantage is that the
mass of the wheels and their inertia do not influence the motion of the
car automatically, so all the effects that result from this need to be
added as a post process.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Previous Raycast Wheel Support</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Previously, raycast cars were
supported by extending the material class with a spring contact mode. This made it possible to have the contact act
like a car suspension (a spring + damper element). In theory this feature could be used for other applications besides vehicle   suspensions, but so far nothing has been attempted. 
<p class="MsoNormal">The wheels' positions were
determined by adding special capsule shapes to the vehicle body, with their y axis pointing downward toward the ground. The shape was flagged with NX_SWEPT_SHAPE to change its behavior from a capsule that would
generate contacts with anything it touched, to a ray that
disregarded the thickness of the capsule and shot a ray along the
capsule's y axis. A single contact point
was created between the ray and any shape it hit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The other aspects of wheel
simulation - steering, axle torque, and tire friction - were not
supported by any special features. 

<p class="MsoNormal">Tire friction was roughly
approximated with a skates model. Here
at each wheel, contact anisotropic friction was used to make the contact
slide easily in the direction of rolling, and slide less easily in the
orthogonal (lateral) direction, in which the wheel does not roll. In general, the frequent and stiff change
between static and dynamic friction  made for problems. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The vehicle was steered by
rotating the capsule shape relative to the car body around the
vertical y axis, so that the x and z axes  that defined
the longitudal and lateral directions for the purpose of tire friction
shifted. This made the direction of
easy sliding change, and turned the vehicle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The vehicle was powered 
by applying a force along the direction of motion, similar to how a
horse-drawn sled is pulled. 

<p class="MsoNormal">User side read back of wheel
state (such as whether ground contact exists, and what the ground
normal force is) was not directly supported; rather, the user had to
parse to the contact stream between the car body and other actors, and
extract this information manually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were also some bugs in
the general anisotropic friction implementation that only became
apparent when the axes of anisotropy were changed by the user, such as  during steering. In response to
steering, the car sometimes rotated even when stationary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another problem is that the
suspension axis and the contact normal are one and the same. This is appropriate on flat terrain where
these two directions are aligned in reality. However,
when a wheel is on sloping terrain, yet the car body is horizontal,
the suspension axis should still be vertical, while the contact normal
should be normal to the terrain. The
simulation always uses the terrain normal for both. This leads to the suspension spring pushing the car somewhat horizontally, an undesirable effect. 

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, because the shapes hit
by the raycast all produced contacts, and all these contacts had
normal forces and friction computed for them, the simulation was not
very realistic when the vehicle rolled over several thin shapes in
close proximity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For legacy support, the old capsule wheel shape and springy material setup can now be simulated using a new flag - NX_WF_EMULATE_LEGACY_WHEEL, read more about <a href="shape_wheel_legacy_flag.html">mapping wheel shape settings</a>.</p>

<h2>Improvements / Bug Fixes to the Old Raycast
Wheel Material Approach</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem with
anisotropic friction mentioned above has been fixed.
Now a stationary car should never rotate in response to steering
alone.
