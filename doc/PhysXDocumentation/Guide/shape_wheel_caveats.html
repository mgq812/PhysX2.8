<h1 align="center">Caveats</h1>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the best simulation, keep the following criteria in mind:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style=""> When using a
digital input for steering (e.g., the keyboard) it is important to
drastically scale down the maximum steering angle as the car's speed
increases. At high speed, a steering angle
of 1 degree will suffice. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style=""> Avoid sudden
changes in steering angle. The input
should be smoothed, it is best to not change the steering angle by more
than 1 degree per time step. NOTE: The input angle is
specified in radians. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"> As this wheel
shape only provides wheel simulation, the user must simulate the engine and transmission by other means. Most
importantly, the engine torque should decrease with increasing
engine speed, otherwise the car will be able to accelerate indefinitely. A  model for increasing air
resistance at increasing speed would be beneficial. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"> Do not use
negative engine torque for braking &#8211; only use it for driving in reverse. If you do not have a separate brake input for a
simple car game, detect if the user input is opposing the direction of
travel, and apply a constant brake torque  until
the car comes to a stop. Then apply a negative engine torque to start moving in reverse.</li><br>
  <br>
  <li class="MsoNormal">If 
    problems occur with the suspension direction, try  the
    NX_WF_WHEEL_AXIS_CONTACT_NORMAL on and then off to see the difference between the two settings. </li><br>
    <br>
    <li class="MsoNormal">All
      shapes that are stabbed by the ray are added to the contact stream,
      even though all but one of these are ignored for the purpose of tire
      friction. Because the tire model
      has its own way of reporting contact and friction forces, these are not
      channeled into the contact stream. All the
      wheel contacts there will report 0 for all forces.
      Keep that in mind when looking at the contact stream.</li><br>
  <br>
  <li class="MsoNormal">When a vehicle accelerates, the motor torque applied to
the wheels results in an equal and opposite torque. This effect is responsible for pitching the chassis
backwards when accelerating. However, with
the raycast car model this force is not explicitly simulated and must
be added by the user as a post process.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Collision detection with wheel shapes are not hardware-accelerated.</li>
