<h1 align="center">Joint Frames</h1>

<p>In the SDK, all joint types share some common properties which are
collected in the NxJoint class and the corresponding descriptor
NxJointDesc. First, they all have two actor pointers. Each of the
actors, including the implicit world actor represented by a NULL
actor pointer, have a  joint frame that is specified relative
to its actor frame. The two frames are  stored in NxJointDesc as
two basis vectors and a point, shown below:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    NxVec3 localNormal[2];<br>    NxVec3 localAxis[2];<br>    NxVec3 localAnchor[2];</pre>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="images/jointAxis.png"></div>
<p> The first (X) basis vector of joint space is called the 'normal',
 the second (Z)&nbsp;is called the 'axis', and the third 
(Y)&nbsp;is  called the 'binormal', computed as a cross product of the
first two. The 'anchor' is the point where the frame is located. The word
'local' denotes that the frames are not in the world but rather in the actor
space.</p>
<p>These two frames uniquely identify the geometric placement of the
joint within the simulation. They never change because
they are fixed relative to the respective actors; however, the frames can end up in different places. The joint
moves when the connected actors move, therefore these frames, when
transformed to the world space via the actor's transform, also move. The image below shows joint frames for a cylindrical
joint. In the far left configuration, the blue z axis of the frames does
not match up, meaning that this configuration suffers from significant
joint error. The other two configurations are permissible.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="Joint Frames" src="images/jointFrames.png"></p>
<p>Use the NxJoint or NxJointDesc methods
  setGlobalAxis() / setGlobalAnchor() to specify the joint frames in world
  space. They will  be transformed internally to the local spaces of the
  actors, which are needed because the simulation does not work
without some error. For example, the ball joint may be pulled apart by a
large force so that the two local frames no longer match up in world
space. It is important to let the user have access to this
error, like all internal states, so that it is possible to save
 and restore  at a later time with the simulation proceeding exactly where it left off. (See <a
 href="joint_projection.html">Joint Projection</a> for a method to
correct severe joint errors.)</p>
<p>Not all joint types  need an entire frame to specify
their geometry. For example, a simple spherical joint only needs
the attachment point to be specified relative to each actor. However,
the additional features of the spherical joint, such as the limits and
spring behavior,  need the additional axes. Typically the axis vector
is the primary axis of the joint, while the other two vectors are
orthogonal to this. (See the API documentation on different joint
types to see how the joints interpret the basis vectors.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The axis convention for joint frames follows a left-handed rule, differing from the world frame convention  which uses a right-handed rule.</p>
<p>The 6 DOF joint is an exception, using a
right-handed convention as shown below:</p>
