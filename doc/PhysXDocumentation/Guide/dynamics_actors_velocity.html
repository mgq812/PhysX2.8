<h1 align="center">Setting the Velocity</h1>
<p>Setting a body's velocity will immediately get it moving in a certain direction. Setting its momentum is another option,
which may be more convenient if you don't know the mass of the
body but want its speed to depend on it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you set the velocity of a body and then run its scene,
after the simulation  is
complete, the velocity of the body may no longer be what you
specified. This is because the simulation overrides your settings if
they are in conflict with a specified constraint. For
example, if a ball is resting on a table and you give it a downward
velocity, it will  change back to 0 when the constraint is resolved in the solver. If you set the velocity of a
chain link that is joined to  other chain links, the
velocity of the chain link you set will decrease, and the other
chain links' velocity will increase, in order for the chain to stay
together.</p>
<p>For linear velocity, note that it is the velocity of the actor's center of mass you set. If this does
not coincide with the origin of the actor's frame, then the velocity of the
actor frame may be different, if the actor is also rotating.</p>
<p>The methods of NxActor that help to set the velocity of a body are
summarized below:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void setLinearVelocity(const NxVec3 &amp;);<br>    void setAngularVelocity(const NxVec3 &amp;);</pre>
<pre>    void setLinearMomentum(const NxVec3 &amp;);<br>    void setAngularMomentum(const NxVec3 &amp;);<p></pre>
<p><i>Note:</i> Setting a velocity large enough to carry an actor outside of the range of a float is
a user error and might produce artifacts; this situation should be avoided.</p>
