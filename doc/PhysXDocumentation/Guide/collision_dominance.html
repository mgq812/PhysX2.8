<h1 style="text-align: center;">Dominance Groups</h1>
<p>With dominance groups one can have all constraints (contacts and joints) created 
between actors act in one direction only. This is useful if you want to make sure that the movement of the rider
of a vehicle or the pony tail of a character doesn't influence the object it is attached to, while keeping the motion of 
both inherently physical. </p>
<p>An NxDominanceGroup is a 5 bit group identifier (legal range from 0 to 31). By default every actor is created in group 0, 
and statics can never leave this group. You change this either in the descriptor (the dominanceGroup member) or by calling
NxActor::setDominanceGroup().</p>
<h2>Meaning</h2>
<p>Whenever a constraint (i.e. joint or contact) between two actors (a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>) needs to be solved, the groups (g<sub>0</sub>, g<sub>1</sub>) of both
actors are retrieved.  Then the NxConstraintDominance setting for this group pair is retrieved with getDominanceGroupPair(g<sub>0</sub>, g<sub>1</sub>).  </p>
<p>In the constraint, NxConstraintDominance::dominance<sub>0</sub> becomes the dominance setting for a<sub>0</sub>, and 
NxConstraintDominance::dominance<sub>1</sub> becomes the dominance setting for a<sub>1</sub>.  A dominance<sub>N</sub> setting of 1.0f, the default, 
will permit a<sub>N</sub> to be pushed or pulled by a<sub>(1-N)</sub> through the constraint.  A dominance<sub>N</sub> setting of 0.0f, will however 
prevent a<sub>N</sub> to be pushed or pulled by a<sub>(1-N)</sub> through the constraint.  Thus, a NxConstraintDominance of (1.0f, 0.0f) makes 
the interaction one-way.</p>
<h2>Default behavior</h2>
<p>The matrix sampled by getDominanceGroupPair(g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>) is initialized by default such that:
<ul>
	<li>if g<sub>1</sub> == g<sub>2</sub>, then (1.0f, 1.0f) is returned</li>
	<li>if g<sub>1</sub> <  g<sub>2</sub>, then (0.0f, 1.0f) is returned</li>
	<li>if g<sub>1</sub> >  g<sub>2</sub>, then (1.0f, 0.0f) is returned</li>
</ul>
In other words, we permit actors in higher groups to be pushed around by actors in lower groups by default.</p>

<p>These settings should cover most applications, and in fact not overriding these settings may likely result in higher performance.
To change the settings, use NxScene::setDominanceGroupPair().</p>
<p>It is not possible to make the matrix asymmetric, or to change the diagonal.  In other words: </p>
<ul>	
	<li>it is not possible to change (g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>) if (g<sub>1</sub>==g<sub>2</sub>)	</li>
	<li>if you set 	
	(g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>) to X, then (g<sub>2</sub>, g<sub>1</sub>) will implicitly and automatically be set to ~X, where:
	<ul>
	<li>~(1.0f, 1.0f) is (1.0f, 1.0f)</li>
	<li>~(0.0f, 1.0f) is (1.0f, 0.0f)</li>
	<li>~(1.0f, 0.0f) is (0.0f, 1.0f)</li>
	</ul>
	These two restrictions are to make sure that constraints between two actors will always evaluate to the same dominance
	setting, regardless of which order the actors are passed to the constraint.</li>
</ul></p>
	
<p>Dominance settings are currently specified as floats 0.0f or 1.0f because in the future we may permit arbitrary 
	fractional settings to express 'partly-one-way' interactions.</p>
