<h1 style="text-align: center;">PhysX Compartments</h1>

In version 2.6, the PhysX SDK introduced the concept of compartments, which allows
hardware rigid bodies, fluids and cloth to be created within a single scene. 
Compartments provide a transparent mechanism of creating interacting rigid bodies, both in software and hardware,
as well as cloth and fluids.<br>
<br>
A compartment represents a sub-instance of one type of physics simulation, for example hardware fluid, hardware rigid body,
or software rigid body. Several compartments may exist inside one scene, (including several of the same type)
and interaction between them and the scene proper is taken care of automatically. This allows for transparent 
manipulation, simulation and interaction, without having to worry about the low-level nuts and bolts.<br>
The SDK manages all links between the compartments. For example, when a material is created, it will be created 
for all rigid body compartments, or if a raycast is performed, the query will return 
all intersected hardware and software objects in all compartments.<br>
<p>
A newly created scene, hardware or software, contains no compartments. Any object that is added to the scene
will be inserted into the scene proper, unless either a compartment is specified in its descriptor, or that 
type of object cannot exist directly in the scene.<br>
The latter applies to for example fluid in a software scene. In such a case, an appropriate default compartment
will be created for the new object if none exists already.
<h2>Creation</h2>
Creating a compartment in a scene is simple; just create a NxCompartmentDesc descriptor, enter the relevant data into
it and call the NxScene::createCompartment method:
<pre>
    NxCompartmentDesc compartmentDesc;
    compartmentDesc.type = NX_SCT_RIGIDBODY;
    compartmentDesc.deviceCode = NX_DC_PPU_0;
    compartmentDesc.gridHashCellSize = 1.0f;
    compartmentDesc.gridHashTablePower = 6;
    
    NxCompartment *compartment = gScene->createCompartment(compartmentDesc);
</pre>
The deviceCode defaults to NX_DC_CPU, which will simulate the objects on the CPU. You can also use NX_DC_PPU_AUTO_ASSIGN, which will assign new compartments to PPUs in a round-robin 
fashion, if more than one are available. When no PPU is available NX_DC_PPU_AUTO_ASSIGN will result in a CPU compartment. Alternatively, you can specify the PPU identifier explicitly.<br>
The gridHashCellSize and gridHashTablePower parameters allow you to tweak the performance of the compartment, adjusting
the parameters of the hash map that is used to mirror the scene's bodies. Larger cell sizes will mirror more geometry 
into the compartment; large hash tables will consume more memory but increase performance when many cells are touched.
<p>
The rigid bodies of the default software compartment are mirrored into the other compartments, where they
function like kinematic actors. There is no communication in the opposite direction, except
in the case of 2-way-enabled cloth or fluid.</p>
<p>Each compartment may also have its own settings for <a href="collision_ccd.htm">continuous collision detection</a>
as well as restricted scene mode (see <a href="hardware_scenes.html">Hardware Scenes</a>). You set these modes using the
flags member of the descriptor. By default, the flag NX_CF_INHERIT_SETTINGS is set. That means compartments default 
to using the modes of the master scene; however, you can clear this flag and manually
specify NX_CF_RESTRICTED_SCENE and NX_CF_CONTINUOUS_CD before you call createCompartment.</p>
<h2>Simulation</h2>
Simulation with compartments is as simple as with a single scene; you need only call
simulate() for the master scene, and all its compartments will be simulated automatically.<br />
<p>By default, the master scene and the compartments are simulated in parallel (as far as possible).
This utilizes the hardware resources optimally.<br />
However, as synchronization with the master scene
must wait until the compartments are done, this will cause a 1 frame lag in the interaction between
e.g. cloth and rigid bodies. If this is unacceptable, there is the option to simulate the master
scene after the compartments are finished (as was the case prior to release 2.6.2); to do this, simply set the
scene flag NX_SF_SEQUENTIAL_PRIMARY.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to retrieve the results from the individual compartments/master scene,
which may further enhance the efficiency of your application. To do this, call fetchResults on the
individual compartments, and/or fetchResults with the NxSimulationStatus parameter NX_PRIMARY_FINISHED 
for the master scene. This will allow read-only access on the individual simulation results before
the simulation as a whole is complete.<br />
Note that you still have to call NxScene::fetchResults with NX_ALL_FINISHED before writing to the
scene or simulating again.</p>
  <h2>Caveats</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Shape counting methods like getTotalNbShapes will report entities belonging to all compartments as well as the master 
  scene. This includes mirrored entities, which means the count will sometimes be higher than might be expected at first glance.</li>
  <li>Meshes must not be dynamic (i.e., changed after creation).</li>
  <li>Meshes must be cooked with the hardware flag set even in SW scenes, if they're to be properly
  mirrored into HW compartments.</li>
  <li>Active Transform Notification for actors in compartments is not supported.</li>
  <li>Objects from different compartments do not interact directly.</li>
  <li>The sweep API is not yet supported by compartments.</li>
  <li>There may be a frame&#8217;s worth of lag between the creation and
destruction of an object and the reaction of the mirroring.</li>
  <li>Dynamically created/released/moved static objects will not be
properly mirrored.&nbsp; All statics should be created before starting
the simulation and should remain in place for the duration of the
simulation.</li>
</ul>
