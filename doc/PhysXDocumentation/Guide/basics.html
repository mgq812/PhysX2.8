<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The SDK has an ANSI C++ programming interface. Internally the SDK is
implemented as a hierarchy of classes. Each class that contains
functionality
that can be accessed by the user implements an interface. This
interface is
effectively a C++ abstract base class. In addition, some stateless
utility
functions are exported.</p>
<h2>Conventions</h2>
<p>Each of the interface classes defines a set of methods. The
following is a
list of coding conventions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>All classes are defined in a header file with the same file name
as the class name.</li>
  <li>Types and classes start with a capital letter.</li>
  <li>Interface classes (all classes visible to the user) are prefixed
with "Nx".</li>
  <li>Methods and variables start with a lowercase letter.</li>
  <li>Return values and parameters in places where a NULL value is
acceptable (usually indicating "default" or "no object") are coded with
pointer (*) syntax. Thus, the user should check for possible NULL
values after calling methods that return a pointer.</li>
  <li>Return values and parameters in places where a NULL value is
unacceptable are coded with reference (&amp;) syntax. In this case,
neither the user nor the SDK checks for NULL values, which do not exist
according to C++. While the user may force a NULL value into the SDK by
dereferencing a NULL pointer, this is obviously a bad idea. If you are
uncertain about the possibility of pointer being NULL, assert it before
passing the dereferenced pointer into the SDK to avoid a blowup.</li>
  <li>When the SDK needs the user to implement some functionality (for
example, memory management) the user needs to implement an interface
defined for this purpose. This scheme is used instead of C callback
functions, but with the same purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p>In order to provide a certain degree of portability, the SDK makes
use of
size specific typedefs, defined in the Foundation\NxSimpleTypes.h.</p>
<p>The SDK's classes NxVec3, NxMat33, NxMat34, and NxQuat
represent a 3-vector, a 3x3 matrix, a 3x4 matrix, and a quaternion
respectively. They are currently configured to use single precision (32
bit)
floating point scalars. These are the types the user should use when
interfacing with the SDK.</p>
<p>The math classes also provide a large selection of type and format
conversion
methods for easy interfacing with your own math classes. Because of the
way
inline code is compiled, you may be able to add your own casting
operators to
these classes without the need to recompile the SDK DLL or make it a
dependency
of your math classes.</p>
<h2>Units</h2>
<p>The SDK does not need to use any particular real world units.
However, it is
important to define a convention when it comes to units in your
application's
artwork pipeline. The SDK uses unitless numbers to
measure three types of basic quantities: mass, length, and time. You
can define
these quantities to be in any units you want. (In our demos we use
kilograms
for mass, meters for length, and seconds for time.) The units of
derived
quantities follow from these basic units. For example, velocity is
always
distance/time, so in our case this is meters/seconds. Other such
derived units
apply to force, impulse, etc.</p>
<p>As with any numeric software, and especially because the SDK uses
only
single precision floating point numbers by default, it is important to
keep the
numbers within a range of relatively high precision. What exactly this
range is
depends on your particular needs regarding simulation accuracy.</p>
