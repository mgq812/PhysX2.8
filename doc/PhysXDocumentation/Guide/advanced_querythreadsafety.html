<h1 style="text-align: center;">Thread Safe Raycasting, Sweep and Overlap
Queries</h1>
In general, it is not safe to use the NVIDIA PhysX API for more than one
thread. However, there are a few exceptions, in particular the APIs
designed to support simulation across multiple threads (see the <a
 href="advanced_threading.html">Threading Interface</a> page for
details) and a subset of the raycasting/sweep/overlap queries. It is also
safe to retrieve the user pointer and names associated with shapes as
long as they are read-only.<br>
<br>
The motivation for making these tests thread safe is
that they are often used for AI and graphics effects, which may be
performed on separate threads. See <a href="collision_raycast.htm">Raycasting</a>, 
<a href="sweep_general.html">Sweep API</a>,
and <a href="collision_overlap.html">Overlap Queries</a> for more
details concerning these functions.<br>
<br>

<br>
The following queries are thread safe:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>NxScene::raycastAnyBounds() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::raycastAnyShape() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::raycastAllBounds() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::raycastAllShapes()<br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::raycastClosestBounds() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::raycastClosestShape() <br>
  </li>
    <br>
  <li>NxScene::linearOBBSweep() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::linearCapsuleSweep() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxActor::linearSweep() <br>
  </li>
    <br>
  <li>NxScene::overlapSphereShapes() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::overlapAABBShapes() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::overlapOBBShapes() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::overlapCapsuleShapes() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::cullShapes() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::checkOverlapSphere() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::checkOverlapAABB() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::checkOverlapOBB() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxScene::checkOverlapCapsule() </li>
</ul>

 Queries which are NOT thread safe are listed below:<br>
<ul>
  <li>NxShape::raycast() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxShape::checkOverlapSphere() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxShape::checkOverlapOBB() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxShape::checkOverlapAABB() <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxTriangleMeshShape::overlapAABBTriangles() <br>
  </li>
  <li>NxTriangleMeshShape::getTriangle() <br>
  </li>
</ul>
NOTE: Be careful when changing
states which will affect the results of a raycast or overlap query. For
example, if filtering constants are modified half way through a query,
the results returned will be inconsistent. To facilitate safe
modification of state, NxScene exposes a pair of functions to prevent
raycasts from running while state is being modified:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>NxScene::lockQueries()</li>
  <li>NxScene::unlockQueries()</li>
</ul>
By default, the SDK acquires a mutex/critical section with the lockQueries() method,
which is released when unlockQueries() is called. The number of
calls to lockQueries() must match a corresponding number of calls
to unlockQueries().<br>
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gScene-&gt;lockQueries();</pre>
<pre>    gMyShapeA-&gt;setGroupsMask(newMaskA);<br>    gMyShapeA-&gt;setFlag(NX_SF_DISABLE_RAYCASTING, true);<br>    gMyShapeB-&gt;setGroupsMask(newMaskB);</pre>
<pre>    gScene-&gt;unlockQueries();</pre>

The following list contains state updates which must be protected by lockQueries():<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Shape groups<br>
  </li>
  <li>Shape flags</li>
  <li>Shape groups mask</li>
  <li>Shape geometry changes</li>
  <li>Shape pose changes</li>
</ul>

NOTE: It is not recommended to change
the state while running a simulation, as changes may lead to
unexpected physical behavior. For example, disabling collisions between
a box and plane when the box is resting on the plane will not cause the
box to fall through it.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
<br>
</span>Overlap queries with individual shapes were not made thread safe
as the overhead associated with doing so can become significant.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span>
<h2>Performance</h2>
There is a memory overhead per additional thread which enters the SDK
to perform a raycast, since each thread must allocate working buffers.
Some of this overhead can be shared if the thread also takes part in
multi threaded simulation (see the <a href="advanced_threading.html">Threading
Interface</a> page).<br>
<br>
A mutex was chosen to protect raycasting because, in most cases, it
yields better performance and less overhead than a reader/writer lock. The exception occurs if very heavy raycasting is
performed from many threads.
Customers with source can instead select the reader/writer lock on
platforms which are statically linked, such as the XBox 360 (see
NxReaderWriterLock.h).<br>
