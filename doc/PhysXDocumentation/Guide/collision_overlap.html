<h1 align="center">Overlap Testing</h1>
In addition to providing <a href="collision_raycast.htm">Raycast</a>
and <a href="collision_triggers.htm">Trigger</a> support, the NVIDIA
PhysX
SDK provides a set of general methods for testing collision primitive
directly against shapes. These are useful when the other collision
methods do not fit the user's needs.<br>
<br>
The methods provided by NxScene allow efficient testing against the
entire collision database, while the methods of NxShape test against
specific objects.<br>
<br>
NxTriangleMesh also provides methods for testing an AABB against the
triangle mesh and retrieving the set of triangles which overlap the
AABB.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Because the SDK double buffers data to allow asynchronous
stepping state modification is not visible to some functions(eg overlap
and raycasting) until a simulate()/fetchResults() pair has been
executed.<br>
<br>
<h2>NxScene::overlapSphereShapes()</h2>
<pre>    NxU32 overlapSphereShapes(const NxSphere&amp; worldSphere, NxShapesType shapeType, NxU32 nbShapes, NxShape** shapes, <br>    NxUserEntityReport&lt;NxShape*&gt;* callback, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, <br>    bool accurateCollision=false);<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></pre>
<p>This method tests a sphere (in the global frame) against shapes in the scene.
The user can test against static, dynamic, or all
shapes by setting the shapeType parameter to NX_STATIC_SHAPES,
NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES or NX_ALL_SHAPES respectively.<br>
<br>
The user has two options for retrieving the overlapping shapes,
detailed below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a buffer large enough to hold all the overlapping shapes
using the shapes and nbShapes parameters. If this buffer is
insufficient
in size, then only the first nbShapes
are returned.</li>
  <li>Provide an NxUserEntityReport callback which directs the SDK to
call the
callback with sets of shapes as they are detected. A small buffer is
allocated on the stack to return shapes, unless a buffer is provided
using the shapes parameter, in which case the SDK uses this temporarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>The activeGroups and groupsMask parameters provide an optional
mechanism for filtering shapes based on their group membership. See <a
 href="collision_broadphase.html">Broad Phase Collision Detection</a>
for more information. <br>
<br>
The accurateCollision parameter provides the option to either collide
against the actual shapes (true) or the AABBs (false) shapes.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>
<pre><span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NxSphere worldSphere(NxVec3(0,0,0), 5);</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxU32 nbShapes = gScene-&gt;getNbDynamicShapes();</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxShape** shapes = new NxShape* [nbShapes];</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (NxU32 i = 0; i &lt; nbShapes; i++)<br>        shapes[i] = NULL;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gScene-&gt;overlapSphereShapes(worldSphere, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES, nbShapes, shapes, NULL);<br></pre>
<h2>NxScene::overlapAABBShapes()</h2>
<pre>    NxU32 overlapAABBShapes(const NxBounds3&amp; worldBounds, NxShapesType shapeType, NxU32 nbShapes, NxShape** shapes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  NxUserEntityReport&lt;NxShape*&gt;* callback, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, <br>    bool accurateCollision=false);</pre>
This method is identical to overlapSphereShapes(), except it tests an
axis aligned bound box against the shape database instead of a sphere.<br>
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>    NxBounds3 worldBounds;<br>    worldBounds.set(NxVec3(-5,-5,-5), NxVec3(5,5,5));</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxU32 nbShapes = gScene-&gt;getNbDynamicShapes();</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxShape** shapes = new NxShape* [nbShapes];</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (NxU32 i = 0; i &lt; nbShapes; i++)<br>        shapes[i] = NULL;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gScene-&gt;overlapAABBShapes(worldBounds, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES, nbShapes, shapes, NULL);</pre>
<h2>NxScene::overlapOBBShapes()</h2>
<pre>    NxU32 overlapOBBShapes(const NxBox&amp; worldBox, NxShapesType shapeType, NxU32 nbShapes, NxShape** shapes,<br>    NxU\serEntityReport&lt;NxShape*&gt;* callback, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, <br>    bool accurateCollision=false) = 0;</pre>
This method is identical to overlapSphereShapes(), except it tests an
oriented bounding box against the shape database instead of a sphere.<br>
<br>
<h2>NxScene::overlapCapsuleShapes()</h2>
<pre>    NxU32 overlapCapsuleShapes(const NxCapsule&amp; worldCapsule, NxShapesType shapeType, NxU32 nbShapes, NxShape** shapes,<br>    NxUserEntityReport&lt;NxShape*&gt;* callback, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, <br>    bool accurateCollision=false) = 0;</pre>
This method is identical to overlapSphereShapes(), except it tests a
world space capsule against the shape database instead of a sphere.<br>
<br>
<h2>NxScene::cullShapes()</h2>
<pre>    NxU32 cullShapes(NxU32 nbPlanes, const NxPlane* worldPlanes, NxShapesType shapeType, NxU32 nbShapes, NxShape** shapes,<br>    NxUserEntityReport&lt;NxShape*&gt;* callback, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL);</pre>
<p>This method is a little different; it tests all shapes in the
collision database against a set of planes. It tests objects against
the planes and returns them if they are in the plane's negative half
space (i.e., on the side which the normal points away from).<br>
<br>
Note that the set of shapes returned by
cullShapes() is not conservative; additional shapes may be returned
which do not intersect the volume formed by the plane's positive half
space. This allows a more efficient implementation. <br>
<br>
A limitation of this function is that the number of planes
should not exceed 32.<br>
<br>
The primary intent of this function is for view frustum culling. The
user can pass through the 6 planes which define the view frustum to
receive all the objects which intersect it for
further processing.<br>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxPlane worldPlanes[2];</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worldPlanes[0]=NxPlane(-1.0f,0.0f,0.0f,0.0f);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worldPlanes[1]=NxPlane(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f,0.0f);</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxU32 nbShapes = gScene-&gt;getNbDynamicShapes();</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxShape** shapes = new NxShape* [nbShapes];</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (NxU32 i = 0; i &lt; nbShapes; i++)<br>        shapes[i] = NULL;</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gScene-&gt;cullShapes(2, worldPlanes, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES, nbShapes, shapes, NULL);</pre>

<h2>NxScene::checkOverlapSphere()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapSphere(const NxSphere&amp; worldSphere, NxShapesType shapeType=NX_ALL_SHAPES, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, <br>        const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, bool accurateCollision=false);</pre>
<p>This method tests the sphere against shapes in the collision database. The &quot;accurateCollision&quot; parameter controls if this method should return true only if the sphere overlaps the actual shape or the AABB of the shape (accurateCollision=false). The default is to only test against the AABB of the shape.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>    NxSphere worldSphere(NxVec3(0,0,0), 5); </pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool intersection = gScene-&gt;checkOverlapSphere(worldSphere, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES);</pre>

<h2>NxScene::checkOverlapAABB()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapAABB(const NxBounds3&amp; worldBounds, NxShapesType shapeType=NX_ALL_SHAPES, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff, <br>    const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, bool accurateCollision=false);</pre>
<p>This method tests the specified AABB against shapes in the collision database. The &quot;accurateCollision&quot; parameter controls if this method should return true only if the specified AABB overlaps the actual shape or the AABB of the shape (accurateCollision=false). The default is to only test against the AABB of the shape.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>    NxBounds3 worldBounds;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worldBounds.set(NxVec3(-5,-5,-5), NxVec3(5,5,5));</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool intersection = gScene-&gt;checkOverlapAABB(worldBounds, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES);</pre>

<h2>NxScene::checkOverlapCapsule()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapCapsule(const NxCapsule&amp; worldCapsule, NxShapesType shapeType=NX_ALL_SHAPES, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff,<br>   &nbsp;    const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, bool accurateCollision=false);</pre>
<p>This method tests the capsule against shapes in the collision database. The &quot;accurateCollision&quot; parameter controls if this method should return true only if the capsule overlaps the actual shape or the AABB of the shape (accurateCollision=false). The default is to only test against the AABB of the shape.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>    NxCapsule worldCapsule(NxSegment(NxVec3(0.0f,0.0f,0.0f),NxVec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f)),1.0f);</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool intersection = gScene-&gt;checkOverlapCapsule(worldCapsule, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES);</pre>

<h2>NxScene::checkOverlapOBB()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapOBB(const NxBox&amp; worldBox, NxShapesType shapeType=NX_ALL_SHAPES, NxU32 activeGroups=0xffffffff,<br>   &nbsp;    const NxGroupsMask* groupsMask=NULL, bool accurateCollision=false);</pre>
<p>This method tests the OBB against shapes in the collision database. The &quot;accurateCollision&quot; parameter controls if this method should return true only if the OBB overlaps the actual shape or the AABB of the shape (accurateCollision=false). The default is to only test against the AABB of the shape.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>    NxBox worldBox(NxVec3(0.0f,0.0f,0.0f),NxVec3(1.0f,1.0f,1.0f), NxMat33(NX_IDENTITY_MATRIX));</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool intersection = gScene-&gt;checkOverlapOBB(worldBox, NX_DYNAMIC_SHAPES);</pre>

<h2>NxShape::checkOverlapSphere()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapSphere(const NxSphere&amp; worldSphere);</pre>
This method is similar to NxScene::checkOverlapSphere(), except that
only a single shape is tested.<br>
<h2>NxShape::checkOverlapAABB()
</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapAABB(const NxBounds3&amp; worldBounds);</pre>
This method is similar to NxScene::checkOverlapAABB(), except that only
a single shape is tested.<br>
<h2>NxShape::checkOverlapCapsule()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapCapsule(const NxCapsule&amp; worldCapsule);</pre>
This method is similar to NxScene::checkOverlapCapsule(), except that
only a single shape is tested.<br>
<h2>NxShape::checkOverlapOBB()</h2>
<pre>    bool checkOverlapOBB(const NxBox&amp; worldBox);</pre>
This method is similar to NxScene::checkOverlapOBB(), except that
only a single shape is tested.<br>
<h2>NxTriangleMeshShape::<span style="font-weight: bold;">overlapAABBTriangles()</span> and NxHeightFieldShape::overlapAABBTriangles() </h2>
<pre>    bool overlapAABBTriangles(const NxBounds3&amp; bounds, NxU32 flags, NxUserEntityReport&lt;NxU32&gt;* callback);<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></pre>
<p>Use this method to test an AABB against a triangle mesh
shape and retrieve a list of triangles which intersect the AABB. The user entity report(callback) is called with batches of triangle indices.
<br>
<br>
Triangle indices returned by overlapAABBTriangles() can be used with
getTriangle() to obtain the triangle's position, edge normals and flags.<br>
<br>
The flag's member provides the following options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>NX_QUERY_WORLD_SPACE - If set, the AABB is specified in the
global frame.
Otherwise, it is assumed to be specified in the shape's frame.<br>
  </li>
  <li>NX_QUERY_FIRST_CONTACT - If set, the overlapAABBTriangles() only
returns the first intersecting triangle that it detects.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>NxTriangleMeshShape::<span style="font-weight: bold;">getTriangle()
</span></h2>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NxU32 getTriangle(NxTriangle&amp; worldTri, NxTriangle* edgeTri, NxU32* flags, <br>		NxTriangleID triangleIndex, bool worldSpaceTranslation=true, bool worldSpaceRotation=true);</pre>
<p>This method allows the user to retrieve information about a triangle
specified by its index (triangleIndex). The edgeTri and flags
parameters
are optional and can be set to NULL.</p>
<ul>
  <li>worldTri - The world space vertex positions of the triangle.</li>
  <li>edgeTri - The world space edge normals of the triangle.</li>
  <li>flags - Specify if an edge of the triangle is convex
or not. NXTF_ACTIVE_EDGE01, NXTF_ACTIVE_EDGE12,
NXTF_ACTIVE_EDGE20 are set if edge 0, 1 or 2 are convex.<br>
  </li>
  <li>worldSpaceRotation, worldSpaceTranslation - allows you to get the
result in the world frame or in the local frame, with any combination
of world or local rotation/translation. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Caveat</h2>
When shapes' poses are updated by the application directly, such as through calling NxActor::setGlobalPose,
their broad phase bounds are not automatically updated until the next simulate call. This may cause incorrect results for 
API calls like overlap tests or cloth attachment. <br />
A newly created entity has as yet no bounds and is not affected by this shortcoming.<br />
If you are experiencing problems with for example overlap testing because of this, you can work around it by deferring such 
relocations until after tests are performed.</li>
