<h1 align="center">Solver Accuracy</h1>

<p>When the motion of a rigid body
is constrained either by contacts or joints, the constraint solver comes into
play. The solver satisfies the constraints on the bodies by reiterating the
constraints restricting the motion of the body a certain number of times. The
more iterations, the more accurate the results become. The solver iteration
count defaults to 4, but may be set individually for each body using the
solverIterationCount field of NxBodyDesc. So far we have only found it
necessary to set this significantly higher for objects with lots of joints and a
small tolerance for joint error. A setting higher than 30 has not been exceeded.</p>
<p>The solver iteration count places an effective limit on the number of bodies that can
be jointed together and simulated realistically; In the worst case, forces working
on a body will only affect connected bodies so many joints distant.</p>

<h2>Fast Rotation</h2>

<p>Objects shaped like a pencil are
difficult to simulate because they can store a lot of energy while rotating around
a short axis. This energy is converted to a very high rotational velocity when
the shape rotates around a longer axis. High rotational velocities can lead to
problems because certain linear approximations of the rotational motion fail to
hold. For this reason, the SDK automatically limits the rotational velocity of
a body to a user definable maximum value. Because this may prevent intentional
fast rotation in objects such as wheels, the user can override it on a per body
basis with the following:</p>

<pre>actor-&gt;setMaxAngularVelocity(maxAV);</pre>

<h2>Floating Point</h2>

<p>For consistent and stable simulation
results, it is necessary to take care when choosing the magnitude of quantities
involved in the simulation. It is important to keep the distances, masses, and
forces involved in the simulation within a tight range to avoid loss of
precision. The exact range of values you use is dependent on the scale of the
world, the complexity of the joints, the number of contacts, etc.</p>

<p>Before you begin designing your
physically simulated levels, etc., it is a good idea to come up with guidelines
for these values.</p>

<p>An example might be the following:</p>

<h2>Adaptive force</h2>
By default, PhysX uses an adaptive force scheme, in which the acceleration of bodies
that are touching large numbers of other bodies is scaled down (on condition that some
of the bodies are in contact with a static object). This causes a dramatic
improvement in solver stability in many cases.<br>
Adaptive force may in some instances lead to unwanted physical artifacts in the way
objects move. Because of this, there is the option of disabling adaptive force throughout
the SDK:
<pre>gPhysicsSDK->setParameter(NX_ADAPTIVE_FORCE, 0);</pre>
However, because of the abovementioned stability implications, this should not be done
lightly.

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Use joint
     springs instead of spring and damper effectors. Joint springs are
     implicitly integrated within the solver and correctly account for transfer
     of momentum across the spring, which also improves behavior with sleeping
     bodies. However, spring and damper effectors are explicitly integrated and
     are not as numerically stable.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>When using
     springs, try not to make them too stiff (i.e., keep the spring constant
     and amount of damping relatively low).<o:p></o:p></span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Make sure
     that you set the bodies center of mass to a reasonable value. As a rule of
     thumb, the center of mass should be inside the collision volume of the
     object if possible. This is especially important if the body has springs
     attached to it. A poorly tuned center of mass can cause the system to be
     poorly conditioned, thus the SDK solver may have trouble converging on a
     solution. The symptom of this is generally jittering bodies.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     stability of the simulation when stacking objects can be improved by
