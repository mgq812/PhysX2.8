<h1 align="center">Memory Management</h1>

<p>When initializing the SDK, it is possible to specify a user defined class for memory management. This mechanism is
not particularly useful for PC development, but is meant to be used on systems
with special memory management requirements. Either way, it allows the user to monitor
the memory usage of the SDK, which is important in many cases.
</p>

<p>To have the SDK use your own
memory allocation methods instead of the standard C malloc/realloc/free, you
need to define a class derived from NxUserAllocator, and define all of its pure
virtual methods. These methods are basically the C runtime malloc/realloc/free,
so on your first try you could just call these methods. An example
implementation is shown below. The SDK does not guarantee any particular usage
patterns that allow you to make a truly specialized allocator. In many cases, the SDK will allocate a chunk of memory with your
allocator at startup, and then internally manage this block for its internal
allocation needs.
</p>

<p>The allocator that you define
should be passed as the optional second argument to the NxCreatePhysicsSDK()
method on startup. After you create the SDK, there is no way to change or
remove the allocator.
</p>

<p>NOTE: No method from the SDK
should be called within the allocator.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>    class MyAllocator : public NxUserAllocator<br>    {<br>    public:</pre>
<pre>        void * malloc(NxU32 size)<br>        {<br>            return ::malloc(size);<br>        }</pre>
<pre>        void * mallocDEBUG(NxU32 size,const char *fileName, int line)<br>        {<br>            return ::_malloc_dbg(size,_NORMAL_BLOCK, fileName, line);<br>        }</pre>
<pre>        void * realloc(void * memory, NxU32 size)<br>        {<br>            return ::realloc(memory,size);<br>        }</pre>
<pre>        void free(void * memory)<br>        {<br>            ::free(memory);<br>        }</pre>
<pre>    } myAllocator;</pre>
<pre>    gPhysicsSDK = NxCreatePhysicsSDK(NX_PHYSICS_SDK_VERSION, &amp;myAllocator, 0);</pre>

<h2>Threading</h2>

<p>The user should
ensure that the allocator they provide is thread safe, since it is called in
the context of the physics processing thread(s) in addition to the user thread.
In general, the OS provided/C library memory allocation routines are
thread safe unless the user is linking to the single thread specific C runtime
library (in which case additional thread synchronization is required).</p>
