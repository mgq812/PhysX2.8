<h1 align="center">Joint Limits</h1>
<p>In the real world, most joints can only move in a certain range,
usually because the hinges' own construction gets in the way. For
example, a door hinge can only move in one direction until it
straightens out at the 180 degree position, and can perhaps reach the
20 degree mark in the other direction. A more complex anatomic joint, like a
person's shoulder, which  as previously mentioned is a spherical
joint, has a much more complicated range of motion.</p>
<p>The SDK provides two different kinds of limit functionality. The
limit point/limit planes functionality of the NxJoint class works generically with all the different joint types. The disadvantage of generic functionality is that it is less intuitive to use than the other joint
specific approaches, which are provided only for <a
 href="joint_spherical.html">Spherical</a>, <a href="joint_6dof.html">6
DOF</a> and <a href="joint_revolute.html">Revolute</a> joints. In the future, custom joint limits may be added to other joint types, but for now, 
the 6 DOF joint provides a superset of most other joint type functionality.</p>
<p>The custom method for creating joint limits consists of specifying a minimum
and maximum rotational angle around a certain rotation axis. For
revolute joints this is the joint axis. For spherical joints there are
two different limits - a twist limit and a swing limit. </p>
<p>The generic method for creating joint limits consists of electing a point attached to one of the two bodies to act as the limit
  point, and specifying several planes attached to the other actor.
  The points and planes move together with the actor they are attached
  to. The simulation then makes certain that the pair of actors only move
  relative to each other so that the 'limit point' stays on the positive
  side of all limit planes. The positive side of a plane is the one in
  which its 'normal' points. To better understand how this model works, examine the pictures below: </p>
<table id="Table1" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="" src="images%5CjointLimits1.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" src="images%5CjointLimits2.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" src="images%5CjointLimits3.png"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hinge joint with limits, and the resulting two extreme
positions. The blue sphere is the 'limit point', and moves with the
silver actor. The planes move with the gold actor.</td>
      <td>Slider joint with four limit planes, and two possible extreme
positions. The planes are specified to move with the silver actor.</td>
      <td><p>The point on line joint is limited by two planes which move with
      the silver actor.  </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>See the API reference documentation for the following methods to
limit a joint:</p>
<pre>    void NxJoint::setLimitPoint(const NxVec3 &amp; point, bool pointIsOnBody2 = true);<br>    bool NxJoint::addLimitPlane(const NxVec3 &amp; normal, const NxVec3 &amp; pointInPlane);</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>    NxPrismaticJointDesc prismaticDesc;</pre>
<pre>    prismaticDesc.actor[0] = actor0;<br>    prismaticDesc.actor[1] = actor1;</pre>
<pre>    prismaticDesc.setGlobalAnchor(globalAnchor);<br>    prismaticDesc.setGlobalAxis(globalAxis);</pre>
<pre>    NxJoint* joint = gScene-&gt;createJoint(prismaticDesc);</pre>
<pre>    //Limit the prismatic joint so that it can only move from its initial position 1.5 units in either direction.</pre>
<pre>    joint-&gt;setLimitPoint(globalAnchor);<br>    joint-&gt;addLimitPlane(-globalAxis, globalAnchor + 1.5 * globalAxis);<br>    joint-&gt;addLimitPlane(globalAxis, globalAnchor - 1.5 * globalAxis);</pre>
