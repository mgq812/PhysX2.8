</h1>
<br>
PhysX provides a powerful mechanism to create rigid body
actors that are simulated on hardware, with a minimum of hassle, by means of compartments.
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>In order to utilize rigid body compartments, simply create 
a hardware or software scene just as usual, then add one or more compartments of type NX_SCT_RIGIDBODY.
Finally, insert new actors into the desired compartment by setting the compartment member of the NxActorDesc:
<pre>
    NxCompartmentDesc compartmentDesc;
    compartmentDesc.type = NX_SCT_RIGIDBODY;
    compartmentDesc.deviceCode = NX_DC_PPU_0;
    
    NxCompartment *hwRBCompartment = gScene->createCompartment(compartmentDesc);
    
    NxActorDesc actorDesc;
    actorDesc.compartment = hwRBCompartment;</pre>
Leaving the compartment parameter NULL (the default) will create the actor in the scene proper and not
in a compartment.<br>
If the compartment can not support further actors, or it doesn't support the 
particular actor that you are trying to create, creation will fail.  It does not
automatically fall back to software mode.
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Joint creation fails between actors in different compartments,
  or between an actor in the primary scene and one in a compartment.</li>
  <li>Effectors between hardware actors not supported.</li>
  <li>Actor or shape pair flags for hardware objects not supported.</li>
  <li>Hardware actors in compartments do not act on actors in the scene proper (no 2 way interaction).</li>
  <li>Only the dynamic actors of the compartment cause objects to be 
	mirrored (static/kinematic actors do not).</li>
  <li>Just as in a normal scene there will be no interaction between static rigid bodies.</li>
  <li>Interaction is one-way, hence objects in the compartment will never affect objects in the master scene, in any way.</li>
  <li>Wheel shapes from the scene proper are not mirrored into the compartments.</li>
  <li>Shape filtering does not work for shapes mirrored into compartments.</li>
</ul>
