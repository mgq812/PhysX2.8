<h1 style="text-align: center;">Sweep API<br>
</h1>
The PhysX Sweep API allows you to take a shape and project it along a
line in space,
detecting the place or places where it intersects other shapes in the
scene. The principle is similar to raycasting; the difference is that a
raycast projects only a single
point through space, producing a line, whereas the Sweep API allows you
to use more complex shapes. To visualize this imagine a sphere swept
along a straight line, it becomes a capsule.<br>
<br>
When performing a sweep the user specifies a motion vector, this
specifies the direction and magnitude of the path the objects is swept
over. The API will in turn return a "time of impact" for the sweep,
this is the fraction of the motion vector that the object can sweep
until it touches another object. Along with this a contact point and
normal are provided, the contact point is the point(or one of the
points) where the objects touch at the time of impact.<br>
<br>
A sweep can be performed using the following entities:
<ul>
  <li><a href="sweep_box.html">Box</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="sweep_capsule.html">Capsule</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="sweep_actor.html">Actor</a></li>
</ul>
Note: A sphere shape sweep can be performed using a capsule sweep with
a height of 0.
<br>
<br>
Results from the sweep test are available through the NxSweepQueryHit
struct:
<pre>    struct NxSweepQueryHit<br>    {<br>	NxF32		t;		//!&lt; Distance to hit<br>	NxShape*	hitShape;	//!&lt; Hit shape<br>	NxShape*	sweepShape;	//!&lt; Only nonzero when using NxActor::linearSweep.<br>					//!&lt; Shape from NxActor that hits the hitShape.<br>	void*		userData;	//!&lt; User-defined data<br>	NxU32		internalFaceID;	//!&lt; ID of touched triangle (internal)<br>	NxU32		faceID;		//!&lt; ID of touched triangle (external)<br>	NxVec3		point;		//!&lt; World-space impact point<br>	NxVec3		normal;		//!&lt; World-space impact normal<br>    };<br></pre>
<br>
NOTE: The internal and external faceIDs refer to the triangle index of
the un-cooked and cooked mesh respectively.<br>
<br>
<h2>Sweep Cache</h2>
A sweep cache can be used to speed up many similar queries. For example
performing a raycast along an NPCs line of sight each many times. The
sweep cache works by storing a list of objects which were close to the
origin of the sweep. Thus on the next sweep with the cache the closest
objects can be tested first culling many other objects very quickly. In
addition the sweep cache may store versions of the geometry in a format
which is optimal for sweep testing.<br>
<br>
<pre>    static NxSweepCache* cache = gScene-&gt;createSweepCache();<br><br>    NxU32 nb = BoxActor-&gt;linearSweep(dir*dist, flags, NULL, 100, results, NULL, cache);</pre>
<br>
As an additional optimization the sweep cache can be restricted to a
particular bounding volume. (So that only shapes occupying this volume
are stored in the sweep cache)<br>
<br>
<pre>    void NxSweepCache::setVolume(const NxBox&amp; box);</pre>
<br>
NOTE: When performing sweep tests from multiple threads the sweep cache
cannot be shared as access to the cache is not serialized. In other
words there should be an independent sweep cache for each thread which
needs a cache.<br>
<h2>Caveats:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sweep testing does not work against NxWheelShape.</li>
  <li>Trigger shapes are excluded from sweep tests.</li>
  <li>All sweep tests are currently performed synchronously.</li>
  <li>It is undefined what happens when the swept volume already
overlaps with something at the start of the query.</li>
</ul>
