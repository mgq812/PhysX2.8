<p class="MsoNormal">While  some improvements
have fixed the most immediate issues with the old raycast wheel model, the
problems with simulation fidelity and lacking features remain. One important customer driven
requirement  to easily query wheel information made it 
necessary to introduce an API object which had a 1:1 correspondence to
each simulated wheel. Previously, the capsule
shape object was in 1:1 correspondence with the wheel, making it possible to share
between wheels and other shapes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To
improve the general usability of the wheel API, the
NxWheelShape was introduced, in addition to NxWheelShapeDesc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NxWheelShape has a simple but
extensible interface that permits simple saving and loading of the
entire wheel state, as well as the modification of any properties
during the simulation. It is also possible
to query the contact status directly from the wheel shape. This provides a complete set of contact properties, including
the local surface material of the other shape and the
currently acting tire forces.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Similarly, it is possible to
disable ALL friction using the NX_MF_DISABLE_FRICTION flag. This, however, is more in support of the new raycast wheel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The main objective is to introduce a more
advanced tire slip based friction model than this standard
textbook approach. Many references are available
to explain the textbook version (for example &quot;Race Car Vehicle Dynamics&quot; by
Milliken). Tire slip based friction separates the overall friction force into a
longitudinal component (responsible for the direction of rolling,  braking and acceleration) and a lateral component (orthogonal to rolling, responsible for keeping the car
properly oriented). In both directions it
is first determined how much the tire is slipping (i.e., what the speed
difference is between the rubber and the road). Then
this slip value is mapped to a tire force by means of a lookup table
filled with empirical tire data. The
predominant property of real tires is that for a certain low slip, they
can exert high tire forces as the rubber compensates for the slip by
stretching, and maintains a static friction of sorts. Later, when the slip gets really high, the forces are reduced as
the tire really starts to slide/spin, and dynamic friction starts to
act.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rather than using an explicit lookup table 
associated with a certain storage and performance overhead,
NxWheelShape introduces NxTireFunctionDesc, which contains the
coefficient parameters  of two cubic
Hermite splines, with which the tire force function is approximated. The coefficients
are very intuitive as they are at the extrema of the
function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To compute the tire slip in the longitudinal (rolling)
direction, it is necessary to know the tire's angular velocity. Initially the customer wanted  the user to keep track of this velocity and pass the current
value to the wheel shape at every simulation step; however, this turned out to be unsatisfactory, as it is very
important to be able to simulate slipless rolling. In this case, the speed of the wheel must correspond almost
exactly to the ground speed. As the
ground speed changes every sub step due to the progressing simulation,
if the user only makes the wheel speed respond every step, then for
several sub steps the wheel may look like it is slipping when in fact
the update is simply not happening in sync.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To remedy this, the wheel shape contains the
update of the wheel speed
by integrating the sum torque acting on the wheel, which is made up of
the sum motor, braking, and ground induced torques. The ground induced torque is equivalent to the longitudinal tire
force that is computed internally. The
motor and brake torques are user inputs, and are treated separately,
because a motor torque opposing the wheel&#8217;s rotation will make it
 reverse rotation, while a very large sustained brake torque
will simply stop the wheel and lock it in place.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By providing a motor and brake axle torque input, it is no longer necessary to apply an explicit force simulating these
effects to the car chassis, as was the case for the previous solution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Further parameters necessitated by the simulation of the
wheel rotation are the wheel radius (to map the axle angular velocity
to a radial velocity at the contact patch), and the wheel mass (to map
the axle torques to accelerations).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For improved convenience, it is no longer needed to
rotate the wheel shape to steer the vehicle. Instead,
a steering angle parameter can be set. Also,
the ray direction is defined to cast along the negative y axis, which
means that simulations using y as the up axis no longer need to turn
the shape on its head to properly orient the wheel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The below diagram illustrates the wheel shape axis
conventions:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt=""
 src="images/rayWheel1.png"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To simplify debugging, the wheel
shape provides visualization of the wheel as part of the shape
visualization mode.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The wheel suspension parameters are identical to the ones
used by the old material based system, but are  now
stored directly in the wheel shape for convenience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A new suspension travel parameter determines the length
of the raycast, as seen in the figure below:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img alt=""
 src="images/rayWheel2.png"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The meaning of the suspension
NxSpringDesc::targetValue has also changed.
It is now decoupled from the suspension travel, and is  a value
between 0 and 1 that determines at what % of whole travel the rest
length of the spring should be, 0 mapping to the default of full
extension along the suspension travel.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another new feature
is that when the suspension is completely compressed, a hard
contact is generated in addition to the spring contact to make sure
that a large force doesn't push the car with soft springs through the
ground. This is a realistic simulation of
a suspension that has bumped up against its hard stops.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, the need to use addForce() to
apply tire forces has been removed, as the explicit
integration of such sustained forces, which are part of simulation loops,
can lead to instability. The
high tire forces acting at low velocities quickly become unstable
because the forces not only stop the body, but depending on the size of
the simulation step, can reverse its direction and lead to oscillation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Instead, there is now a way to map the tire forces
to a constraint that is passed into a solver. The results are
unconditionally stable, even for very high tire forces. The mapping of the tire force to a constraint gave rise to
another parameter, the stiffnessFactor of the tire descriptor. This parameter has no good physical
interpretation and has simply to do with mapping the tire forces to a
spring constant that the solver can work with.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because the wheel implementation sorts through contacts along the
ray and only takes the contact closest to the ray origin, multiple simultaneous contacts are not an issue.</p>
