<p>The most important property of an actor is its pose (position and
orientation) in the world. Because the SDK provides a good deal of
flexibility in this area, it is important to understand some spatial
relationships involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, suppose we would like to simulate a
table. The table is modeled in 3d software using a rectangular
table top and four rectangular legs. The table will be an art asset
for a computer game, and it will be instanced and placed at various
spots using a level editor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both high detail geometry and  bounding boxes for the
table top and legs are exported from the 3d software (either manually or automatically). The physics SDK
is not concerned with the graphical representation, but the
bounding boxes will be instanced in the SDK as shape objects. The image below shows what the table may look like in the game editor, along with its significant reference frames.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Table" src="images/table.png"></p>
<p></p>
<p>NOTE: To make things more interesting, our table has a large chunk cut from one leg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The space in which all the actors are positioned is called the world
or global space. A space is also sometimes called a frame or reference
frame.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The actor object corresponding to the entire table has its own
frame, the actor frame. This is also known as the local space of the
actor. The actor frame is defined so that when placed at zero
height in the world, the legs of the table touch the floor, making
it easy for people editing the level to place tables in a simple way,
eventually using the editor's snap-to-grid functionality to make sure
the table is at a correct height. In other words, actor frames can be randomly placed and
are usually chosen with other practical or artistic considerations in
mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In regards to collision detection, the table is made up of five bounding box shapes. These have fixed poses relative to the
actor frame. At its origin, defined as center, each box has its
own local frame called the shape frame, oriented along the primary axis
of the box. Other types of shapes have similar local frames
defined. For example, the local frame of a triangle mesh is the space
in which the triangle vertices are defined (which can otherwise be
arbitrary).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the placement of shapes, the SDK computes the actor's center of
mass, assuming it is dynamic. (You may manually specify a center of mass if preferred.) The center of mass is the point around which real
physical objects rotate  unless they are constrained in some
way. The center of mass may have an orientation which is not
always the same as that of the actor frame. In our example, the table
is missing half of a leg. This makes the mass distribution a bit
asymmetric, physically expressed by the center of mass
frame's rotation. The center of mass frame is often abbreviated to body
or mass frame. The center of mass pose is stored relative to the
actor frame.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The NxActor methods,</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void setGlobalPose(const NxMat34&amp;);<br>    void setGlobalPosition(const NxVec3&amp;);<br>    void setGlobalOrientation(const NxMat33&amp;);<br>    void setGlobalOrientationQuat(const NxQuat&amp;);</pre>
<p></p>
<p>serve to position the actor frame in world space, and the
corresponding get*() methods retrieve it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that the method,</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    const NxMat34&amp; getGlobalPose()const</pre>
<p></p>
<p>is normally the most convenient way to obtain the actor's transform for
rendering. This can then be sent to OpenGL (or similarly to
Direct3D) through the following:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    float glmat[16];//OpenGL matrix.<br>    actor-&gt;getGlobalPose()-&gt;getColumnMajor44(glmat);<br>    glMultMatrixf(glmat);//Send to OpenGL.</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The methods,</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void setCMassOffsetLocalPose(const NxMat34&amp;);
    void setCMassOffsetLocalPosition(const NxVec3&amp;);
    void setCMassOffsetLocalOrientation(const NxMat33&amp;);</pre>
<p></p>
<p>set the mass frame's pose relative to the actor frame, or in
other words, determine the actor's center of mass. This is
computed and defaulted by the SDK to the correct values based on
the mass distribution of the actor's shapes. You may instead use the follwing
method to set the mass center's frame relative to the global frame:
<pre>    void setCMassOffsetGlobalPose(const NxMat34&amp;);
    void setCMassOffsetGlobalPosition(const NxVec3&amp;);
    void setCMassOffsetGlobalOrientation(const NxMat33&amp;);</pre>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>To set the pose of the component boxes (or other shapes) relative to
the actor frame,  the following methods of NxShape may be used:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>    void setLocalPose(const NxMat34&amp;);<br>    void setLocalPosition(const NxVec3&amp;);<br>    void setLocalOrientation(const NxMat33&amp;);</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Setting the position of an object directly is sometimes unavoidable
(most commonly at the start of a simulation, or if you want to
'teleport' an object to a different place), but may also be convenient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The SDK does not prevent you from setting the poses of constrained
objects. For example, if you had a linked chain of bodies, and added a
certain value to the bodies' positions, the
simulation would continue without problem. However, if you changed the
position of only one body, the simulation would try to fix the
constraint error you have inadvertently introduced by applying huge
forces to the bodies during the next time step. This may lead to
the simulation failing or the scene 'exploding'. To summarize, setting
the pose of objects directly is not necessarily a bad thing, just watch out that you don't accidentally pull joints apart or put
bodies into each other - your collision
detection system won't like it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NOTE: When specifying the orientation, there is no performance difference between
the quaternion or the matrix representation, as
the SDK uses both formats internally.</p>
