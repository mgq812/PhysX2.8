</h1>
<h2>Soft Limits</h2>
<p>The d6joint allows a limit to be 'soft' (i.e.,
allows a certain amount of limit violation when the joint is pushing
against a limit). This creates a smoother and more realistic response
when an object hits a limit, in addition to improving the joint's stability.
<br>
<br>A common scenario for using soft limits is when the joint is being
driven by animation data. In some cases, the data may not be perfect and
try to force the joint outside the range defined by its limits. In
this case, it looks more realistic to give a little than to stop the motion
dead.<br>
<br>
To enable soft limits for a joint, set the spring and damping
parameters of the appropriate joint limit to a positive value. A value
of zero is the default,  used to signify a hard limit.<br>
<pre>    //Single linear limit<br>    d6Desc.xMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_LIMITED;<br>    d6Desc.yMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br>    d6Desc.zMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br><br>    d6Desc.linearLimit.value = limitRadius;<br>    d6Desc.linearLimit.spring = 0.5f;<br>    d6Desc.linearLimit.damping = 0.1f;<br></pre>
<h2>Restitution</h2>
When a joint hits a limit, it is possible to give the limit a bounce so
that it reflects back with a proportion of the velocity that it hits
the limit with (along the axis of the limit). This is similar to
specifying a restitution value when dealing with contacts. A
restitution value of zero is the default which causes the joint to stop
dead - a value of 1 will cause the joint to bounce back from the limit
with the same
velocity that it hit.<br>
<br>
In situations where the joint has many locked DOFs (e.g., 5) the
restitution may not be applied correctly. This is due to a limitation
in the solver which causes the restitution velocity to become zero as
the solver enforces constraints on the other DOFs.<br>
<br>
This limitation applies to both angular and linear limits; however, it
is generally most apparent with limited angular DOFs.<br>
<br>
Disabling joint projection and increasing the solver iteration count
may improve this behavior to some extent.<br>
<br>
Also, combining soft joint limits with joint motors trying to drive past those limits may affect 
stability. This can be alleviated through either tweaking the limit's and drive's parameters (such as
making the target lie within the limits), or avoiding the situation entirely, either by eschewing the 
combination or by switching off the motor.<br>
<pre>    //Single linear limit<br>    d6Desc.xMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_LIMITED;<br>    d6Desc.yMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br>    d6Desc.zMotion = NX_D6JOINT_MOTION_FREE;<br><br>    d6Desc.linearLimit.value = limitRadius;<br>    d6Desc.linearLimit.restitution = 0.5f;</pre>
