<h2>Basic Profiling</h2>

<p>Basic profiling information can be retrieved programmatically 
through the readProfileData() member of NxScene.  This returns a NxProfileData object, 
which contains an array of NxProfileZone-s.  The exact list of the zones exposed may vary from
release to release, but certain zones defined by the NxProfileZoneName enum can be easily searched for 
using NxProfileData::getNamedZone().

<h2>Detailed Profiling</h2>
For customers with a source code release, the NVIDIA PhysX SDK can be
compiled
with profiling support for the software core. To control this there is
a define in NxProfiler.h called NX_ENABLE_PROFILER. When 
enabled, timing information is gathered during the simulation and can be retrieved either through the <a href="tools_vrd.html">Visual
Remote Debugger</a> or
programmatically through the readProfileData() member of NxScene.<br>
<br>
Profiling data is gathered as a series of nested zones. For example,
there might be a zone which provides the timing for the simulation,
nested within timing for  collision detection, constraint
solving, etc. Profiling zones are presented to the user through the
NxProfileData and NxProfileZone classes. A profile zone contains the following:
<ul>
  <li>The name of the zone (name)</li>
  <li>The number of times the zone was entered (callCount)</li>
  <li>The time it took to execute the zone, including sub
zones (hierTime)</li>
  <li>The time it took to execute the zone, minus that for nested
zones (selfTime)</li>
  <li>Recursion level, i.e., the number of parent zones  (recursionLevel)</li>
  <li>The percentage time the zone took of its parent zone</li>
</ul>
When the scene is executed across multiple threads, the timing results
for all zones on all threads are concatenated in the array of zones
provided by readProfileData().<br>
<br>
Since the profiling data is dependant on the internal structure of the
SDK, the zones defined will vary between releases. For best results, new
zones should be defined when required. See Scene::Scene() and
Profiler.h for details.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above information, it is possible to enable an
additional counter for the zones using the NX_ENABLE_PROFILER_COUNTER
define. This counter has specific uses on some platforms. For example,
on XBox 360 it is possible to modify ProfileClock.h (when source code is
available) to provide level 2 cache misinformation.<br>
<br>
NOTE: There is a significant
performance penalty for enabling the profiler, in the order of 10-20%,
so it should only be enabled when needed (and not using an external
profiler).<br>
<br>
NOTE: When retrieving profiler data, make sure
the SDK executes a consistent number of substeps, or at least one; otherwise, profiler results may be misleading.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

<h2>Scene Stats</h2>
The NVIDIA PhysX SDK provides a simple way of retrieving statistics
about the
current scene, such as body count, constraint count, etc. This
information is accessed through the <a href="tools_vrd.html">Visual
Remote Debugger</a> or through the getStats() member of NxScene.<br>
<br>
The following list contains some scene statistics:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Current number of contacts and maximum number of contacts</li>
  <li>Current number of constraints and maximum number of constraints </li>
  <li>Number of shapes</li>
  <li>Number of joints</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
See the API reference for specific details.<br>
There is also an <a href="advanced_extended_stats.html">extended scene stat</a> class that may be used to retrieve more in-depth information on the simulation.
