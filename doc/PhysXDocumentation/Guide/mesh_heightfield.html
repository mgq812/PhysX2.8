<h1 style="text-align: center;">Heightfield Meshes</h1>
A heightfield is like a bumpy plane. It is also infinite in two
dimensions, and defines an elevation along the third. All values below
the elevation (or a user definable depth) are treated as being
inside the heightfield volume. It is possible for
the heightfield triangulation to be irregular. The only
difference between a heightfield mesh and a general triangle mesh is
that a
heightfield is not a closed shape, but rather  the
boundary of a volume that extends downward for a certain distance. This
way, fast moving objects will not fall through the terrain if traveling across its surface in a single time step as they would in a 
general triangle mesh.
<p>Provide the triangles for the heightfield as in an arbitrary triangle mesh:</p>
<pre>    NxTriangleMeshDesc terrainDesc;</pre>
<pre>    terrainDesc.numVertices= TERRAIN_NB_VERTS;<br>    terrainDesc.numTriangles= TERRAIN_NB_FACES;<br>    terrainDesc.pointStrideBytes= sizeof(NxVec3);<br>    terrainDesc.triangleStrideBytes= 3*sizeof(NxU32);<br>    terrainDesc.points= gTerrainVerts;<br>    terrainDesc.triangles= gTerrainFaces;</pre>
<p>Heightfield geometry must be flat in  that the
projections of all triangles onto the heightfield plane must be
disjointed. (If the heightfield vertical axis is y, the heightfield
plane is spanned by x and z). Set which local
(vertex-space) axis should be the height axis, and how far along this
axis the implicit heightfield volume should extend:</p>
<pre>    terrainDesc.heightFieldVerticalAxis= NX_Y;<br>    terrainDesc.heightFieldVerticalExtent= -1000.0f;</pre>
<p>Objects that are under the surface of the heightfield but above this cutoff are treated as colliding with the heightfield. The heightFieldVerticalExtent has to be outside of the mesh's vertex
coordinate range along the heightFieldVerticalAxis. This may be set to a positive value, in which case the extent will be cast
along the opposite side of the heightfield. A smaller
finite value for the extent can be set if space beneath the
heightfield is desired, such as a cave.</p>
<p>In the code sample above, NX_Y axis was used, other options being NX_X and NX_Z. Using a negative value for the extent (also shown) provides the necessary down direction, as opposed to  making the extent positive
which would simulate up. This complete, the remaining process follows the exact steps of a triangle mesh (i.e., the mesh data needs to be cooked first (see the <a
 href="collision_cooking.htm">Cooking</a> section), then a triangle mesh is created from the cooked data).</p>
<p>NOTE:
<ul>
	<li>In most circumstances, the <a href="shape_heightfield.html">Heightfield
Shape</a> is preferable to a mesh-based heightfield when developing for the PhysX SDK 2.4 and above. The
heightfield shape will use less memory and
perform better than  a heightfield mesh. The
tessellation of triangles for a heightfield shape is assumed to be
regular, unlike a heightfield mesh.</li>
	<li>Collisions with Heightfields are not hardware-accelerated.</li>
</ul>
