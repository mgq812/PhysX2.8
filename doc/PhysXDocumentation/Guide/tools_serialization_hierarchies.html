<h1 style="text-align: center;">Serialization Hierarchies</h1>
<p>When creating a collection using NxuStream, you can organize assets into a hierarchical structure
using the NXU::addSceneInstance() and NXU::addToCurrentSceneInstance() functions. This allows you to 
to create instances of assets as many times as you like without having the collection redundantly
store all data for each instance.</p>
<p>The basic building block for this hierarchy is the <i>scene instance</i>, which acts both as a placeholder
for another asset (scene or scene instance) that already exists in the collection, and as a container
for subordinate scene instances. This allows for a tree structure, where each node can be either abstract
(referring only to other scene instances) or concrete (referring to an existing scene).<br />
When constructing a collection, NxuStream keeps a pointer to the <i>current</i> scene instance.
The addSceneInstance function inserts a new scene instance as a child of the current instance;
addToCurrentSceneInstance does the same, but also makes the newly created instance current, effectively
moving down the tree one level. To return to the previous level, call NXU::closeCurrentSceneInstance().</p>
<p>Both addSceneInstance and addToCurrentSceneInstance take the following arguments:
<ul>
    <li><i>c</i> - the NxuPhysicsCollection that is being added to</li>
    <li><i>instanceId</i> - the name to give the newly created scene instance</li>
    <li><i>sceneName</i> - the name of the existing scene or scene instance for which the new instance is a placeholder</li>
    <li><i>rootNode</i> - pose offset of the instance; relative to its parent if applicable, otherwise to the global frame.</li>
    <li><i>ignorePlane</i> - whether or not to ignore ground planes upon instantiation.  True by default.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Instantiating the hierarchy</h2>
<p>The following is the procedure NxuStream follows when instantiating a collection:
<ul>
    <li>If there are no scene instances, instantiate each scene in the collection.</li>
    <li>otherwise, for each scene instance:
    <ul>
        <li>If the instance points to a scene, instantiate that scene.</li>
        <li>Otherwise (the instance points to a scene instance) recurse.</li>
        <li>Finally, recurse for each child instance - but <i>only</i> if this is not a top-level
            scene instance (see below).</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
Note that NxuStream does not recurse over children for top-level nodes. This is to allow
you to create abstract scene instances - i.e. instances that will not automatically be instantiated
unless they're referenced somewhere in the hierarchy. For example, you may want to set up a "room" template, composed of 
instances of "chairs" and "tables", without having a room automatically created in your scene at the origin.<br />
Also note that the scenes themselves are automatically made abstract in this sense as soon as you add an instance
to the collection; no actual scenes will be instantiated unless referenced by a scene instance (that is not itself abstract).</p>
<h2>The instance scene</h2>
<p>It's important to realize that all the objects created by a call to NXU::instantiateCollection will go into the <i>same</i>
NxScene. If you do not supply a defaultScene with the call, the first scene actually created by the above procedure will
become the instance scene and everything else will be created in it.<br />
Thus, the scene instance hierarchy is not used to create multiple scenes, but rather to populate one scene with assets in a
structured and data-efficient way. The scenes in the collection are viewed not as independent NxScenes but as containers 
for physics assets.
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>As an illustration of the above, picture a collection containing a game level that consists of a street with cars.
The cars are all the same physical model and so lend themselves to instancing. Furthermore, they contain drivers - ragdolls -
which are also all the same. There are ragdolls in other parts of the scene as well.</p>
<p>To create this setup, you create a scene in PhysX for each of the assets (street, car, ragdoll) and add each to the collection
using NXU::addScene, with a descriptive identifier string: "Street", "Car", "Ragdoll".</p>
<p>Then, you create the abstract person-in-car instance:
<pre>NXU::addToCurrentSceneInstance(c, "CarAndDriver", 0, NxMat34());</pre>
and populate it with the car and the ragdoll:
<pre>NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "CarBody", "Car", NxMat34());
NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "Driver", "Ragdoll", NxMat34());</pre>
Finished with CarAndDriver, we close it:
<pre>NXU::closeCurrentSceneInstance();</pre></p>
<p>Now you can create the master level instance and begin to populate it.
<pre>NXU::addToCurrentSceneInstance(c, "LevelInstance", 0, NxMat34());
NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "StreetInstance", "Street", NxMat34());

NxMat34 carOffset = ...;
NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "CarInstance1", "CarAndDriver", carOffset);
carOffset = ...;
NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "CarInstance2", "CarAndDriver", carOffset);
...
NxMat34 dollOffset = ...;
NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "Pedestrian1", "Ragdoll", dollOffset);
...
NXU::closeCurrentSceneInstance();</pre></p>
<p>Finally, create the concrete instance - a top-level scene instance referring to "LevelInstance" and with no children:
<pre>
NXU::addSceneInstance(c, "Level", "LevelInstance", NxMat34());
</pre></p>
<p>On disk, this collection will be compact, containing the data for the car, ragdoll and street only once, plus the
hierarchy information - roughly the size of the code used to generate it. When instantiated, one scene will be populated
with street, cars and ragdolls; the scene used (as far as scene parameters and flags are concerned) will be that of the
original "Street" NxScene, since that is the first one encountered in the concrete scene instance "Level". Of course,
you can also put everything in an existing scene using the defaultScene argument of NXU::instantiateCollection.</p>
