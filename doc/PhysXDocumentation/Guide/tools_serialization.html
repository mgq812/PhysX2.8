<h1 style="text-align: center;">Serialization Class Library</h1>
The serialization class library provides a method of saving a complete
scene into a portable binary format (ascii is supported for write-only
to aid debugging).<br>
<br>
In addition, the serialization library is flexible enough to write out
parts of a scene (e.g., individual actors) and interleave this data into
the user's file format. The advantage of using the serialization class
library is that the user does not have to write tedious serialization
code and deal with the many special cases associated with serializing
the objects.<br>
<br>
<h2>Collections</h2>
<p>The serialization library accomplishes all reading and writing by means
of collections, NXU::NxuPhysicsCollection.<br />
A 'physics collection' is a set of related scenes, meshes, actors, constraints, 
cloth, and fluids. If can be everything in an entire game level or something 
as simple as just one 'chair'. Once a physics collection has been instantiated 
on the SDK it can be released without memory leaks or dangling pointers.</p>
<p>Note: Though the collection has a set of public methods and members, these are
for internal use and you should not rely on them when using NxuStream; instead, 
interact with collections through the global NXU:: methods 
(see the <a href="./../../Serialization/namespaceNXU.html">NXU namespace</a>).
The members of NxuPhysicsCollection are not considered public API and may
change without notice.</p>
<p>A collection is saved or retrieved using the functions NXU::loadCollection and
NXU::saveCollection (all the serialization interface is located within the namespace
"NXU"). The file format is specified using the enum NXU::NXU_FileType:
<ul>
  <li>NXU_FileType::BINARY - Binary stream. Efficient but not human-readable nor, in general, cross-version compatible.<br>
  </li>
  <li>NXU_FileType::XML - Human-readable XML stream.<br>
  </li>
  <li>NXU_FileType::COLLADA - Collada stream.</li>
</ul>
Of the above, the binary and xml formats are reflective of the SDK; that is, they 
store all relevant information. The COLLADA format conforms to the COLLADA industrial
standard and doesn't contain all features in PhysX; on the other hand, it contains
graphics information that is ignored by PhysX.
<br>
Collections should be released with NXU::releaseCollection() when
they are no longer needed:<br>
<pre>    /* Read a collection from a binary serialized file:*/<br><br>    NXU::NxuPhysicsCollection* collection = NXU::loadCollection(pFilename, NXU::NXU_FileType::BINARY);</pre>
<pre>    //...</pre>
<pre>    /* Create an XML output file */</pre>
<pre>    NXU::saveCollection(collection, pFilename2, NXU::NXU_FileType::XML);</pre>
<pre>    NXU::releaseCollection(collection);</pre>

<h2>Saving Physics State</h2>
To save a scene or objects within a scene, the user must create a
NxuPhysicsCollection object; subsequently, the user can call
the NXU::add... function to save individual components or the
entire scene.<br>
<br>
After adding objects to the collection, call NXU::saveCollection() 
to serialize the added contents to a file. It is also possible to 
serialize into a memory buffer using NXU::saveCollectionToMemory.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you may use the convenience functions NXU::extractCollectionSDK 
and NXU::extractCollectionScene to automatically create collections
containing the entire SDK or a whole scene, respectively.<br>
In addition, there's one more convenience function, NXU::coreDump, which
entirely hides the interface to collections and simply writes the entire
SDK to a file of the specified type.
<br>
<h2>Loading Physics State</h2>
Loading physics using the serialization library is a simple matter of
retrieving the collection using NXU::loadCollection, and then
instantiating it.<br />
When instantiating a collection using NXU::instantiateCollection, you have
the option of providing a NxScene pointer. If you do, the instantiation will
not create a new scene, but insert all its contents into the provided scene.
You may also specify a spatial transform when doing this, which allows you to
place the instantiated objects wherever you wish in the existing scene.
<pre>
    NxMat34 instanceFrame;
    instanceFrame.t = NxVec3(10.0f, 0, 0); // Moves the instance 10 units in the positive x direction
    NXU::instantiateCollection(collection, gPhysicsSDK, existingScene, &instanceFrame, NULL);</pre>
<h2>Instances and hierarchy</h2>
<p>NxuStream supports a hierarchical scheme which allows you to save a great deal of
storage space using instantiation. The basic idea is simple: A scene may be
stored once but instanced multiple times in different places. See <a href="tools_serialization_hierarchies.html">Hierarchies</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2>User Callbacks</h2>
The serialization class library provides a couple of callback
interfaces to allow the user to control scene creation and associate
their own data with physics objects as they are loaded.<br>
<br>
NXU_userNotify provides one set of callbacks which are executed just after
an object is created and all its state has been initialized, and another
set which is invoked before creation, allowing you to modify the descriptors
after they're read from the collection, and abort creation by returning "false".<br>
The first set is prefixed "NXU_notify..." and the second "NXU_preNotify...".
Overload any or all of these methods in order to receive the particular notifications.
<br>
The scene pre-creation callback is special in that it allows you to specify an existing
scene to put the contents in, rather than just modifying the descriptor; returning NULL will
create a new scene from the descriptor.
<pre>   class MyUserNotify : public NXU::NXU_userNotify
    {
        public:
        
        //Notify the application of a scene creation.
        virtual void NXU_notifyScene(NxU32 sceneNo, NxScene *scene, const char *userProperties) {...}
        //Notify application of a joint creation.
        virtual void NXU_notifyJoint(NxJoint *joint, const char *userProperties) {...}

        //Control creation of scenes        
        virtual NxScene * NXU_preNotifyScene(NxU32 sceneNo, NxSceneDesc &amp;desc, const char *userProperties)
        { 
            desc.userData = ...; 
            return NULL;
        }
        //Control creation of joints        
        virtual bool NXU_preNotifyJoint(NxJointDesc &amp;desc, const char *userProperties)
        { 
            desc.userData = ...; 
            return true;
        }
    };</pre>
<pre>

    ...
    MyUserNotify gUserNotify;
    NXU::instantiateCollection(collection, gPhysicsSDK, NULL, NULL, &gUserNotify);</pre>
<h2>Compartments</h2>
Being part of a scene, compartments require some special consideration when serializing scenes
that contain them. If such a scene is instantiated "as is", each compartment will be recreated with its original contents 
inside it as expected.
<p>However, if a scene with compartments is instantiated inside another scene rather than by itself, NxuStream will attempt
to match source and destination compartments so as not to create unnecessarily many of them. Each compartment in the source
scene will be matched to the first compartment with <i>the same descriptor</i> found in the destination scene, and its
contents placed in that destination compartment. If no matching compartment is found a new one is created.</p>
<p>For example, if a scene with a fluid compartment is instantiated in an existing scene with an identically (parameter-wise)
defined fluid compartment, the fluids will be instantiated inside the existing compartment instead of a new one. If there
are two identical fluid compartments in the source, only the first will be absorbed into the existing fluid compartment,
while a new one is created to accept the contents of the second.</p>
<p>You can of course always override this behavior by overloading the pre-create callbacks for the relevant content types
and manually setting the compartment to place them into.</p>
<h2>Cloth and soft bodies</h2>
Cloth and soft bodies contain a certain amount of internal state information that is not normally visible to the user (it
is not part of the descriptor). By default, this internal state is not saved by NxuStream. Though greatly reducing memory 
costs, this means that a cloth or soft body will revert to its initial shape when it is instantiated.
<p>In particular, cloth attachments are not serialized on a per-particle basis by default.
This means that when instantiated the best NxuStream can do to recreate the attachment is call NxCloth::attachToShape, which
may attach different particles than originally, if the shape has moved relative to the cloth.</p>
<p>If this is not acceptable, you can elect to save the active state when serializing. To do this, you call:
<pre>NXU::setUseClothActiveState(true);</pre>
or
<pre>NXU::setUseSoftBodyActiveState(true);</pre>
before serializing that asset.</p>
<p>Note that active state serialization of metal cloth is not currently supported.</p>
