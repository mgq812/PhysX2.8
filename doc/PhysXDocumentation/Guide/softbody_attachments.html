<h2>Attaching Soft Bodies to Fixed Points</h2>
<pre>     void attachVertexToGlobalPosition(const NxU32 vertexId, const NxVec3 &amp;pos);</pre>

<p></p>

<p>Soft body particles can be attached to fixed points specified in the
global frame. The vertexId identifies the soft body particle to attach to the
global position. The id corresponds to the index into the vertex position
array passed to the API when cooking the soft body mesh, or, equivalently,
the index of the vertex position as returned in the vertex position user
buffer. The user may also attach vertices that get created during the tearing
process.</p>

<p>A useful method for obtaining a vertex ID, for example when dragging with
a mouse, is to cast a ray against the soft body. See <a
href="softbody_misc.html">Other Soft body Features</a> for more information.
<br>
</p>

<h2>Attaching Soft Bodies to Shapes</h2>
<pre>     void attachVertexToShape(NxU32 vertexId, const NxShape *shape, const NxVec3 &amp;localPos, NxU32 attachmentFlags);</pre>
Soft bodies can be attached to rigid body shapes in much the same way as
attaching the soft body to a global position. But instead of specifying the
global position, the position is relative to the shape (i.e., a position in
the shape's coordinate frame). As the shape moves, this position will change
in the global frame, pulling the soft body with it.<br>
<br>
The attachment shape can be either static or dynamic (i.e., attached to a
dynamic actor).<br>
<br>
 The attachmentFlags parameter specifies how the soft body interacts with the
shape. The two possible values are shown below:<br>
<br>

<ul>
  <li>    NX_SOFTBODY_ATTACHMENT_TWOWAY - The object can pull the soft body
    and the soft body can move the object (only for dynamic shapes). <br>
    <br>
    The default is one way interaction, i. e., the object can pull the soft
    body, but the soft body cannot move the object. If the object moves then
    the soft body will follow it. However, if the soft body is pulled, the
    object will behave as if it is fixed and not move.
    <p>NOTE: Care should be taken if objects with small masses (either
    through low density or small volume) are attached, as the simulation may
    easily become unstable. The NxSoftBodyDesc.attachmentResponseCoefficient
    field should be used to lower the magnitude of the impulse transfer from
    the soft body to the attached rigid body in such a situation. Other
    workarounds are simply increasing the density of the object or adding
    linear and angular damping to it.</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>    NX_SOFTBODY_ATTACHMENT_TEARABLE - When this flag is set the
    attachment can be torn. ie if enough force is exerted on the attachment
    then it will snap.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attaching Soft Body to Shapes from Collisions</h2>
<pre>     void attachToCollidingShapes(NxU32 attachmentFlags);</pre>
<pre>     void attachToShape(const NxShape *shape, NxU32 attachmentFlags);</pre>

<p>Since intermesh collisions are not supported, two soft bodies may freely
penetrate each other. As a useful and fast workaround for this problem, rigid
bodies can be used as cores inside soft bodies. As skeletons, they also give
the soft body a firm interior and improve the global rubbery behavior of soft
bodies. As an example, see the pile of frogs above. On the left you see the
frog triangle meshes. The middle image shows the tetrahedral meshes used for
simulation and on the right, the rigid cores are shown. In this case,
capsules were used.</p>

<p>attachToCollidingShapes() attaches to any rigid body shape in the scene.
attachToShape() is less indiscriminate and only attaches to a specified
shape. attachmentFlags behaves in a similar way to the attachmentFlags
parameter of attachVertexToShape().<br>
<br>
It should be noted that this method of attachment will not work with general
triangle meshes because the inside/outside of a general triangle mesh is not
defined.<br>
</p>

<h2>Detaching Soft Body</h2>
<pre>     void detachFromShape(const NxShape *shape);</pre>
<pre>     void freeVertex(const NxU32 vertexId);</pre>

<p>Soft body particles can be detached as well as attached. detachFromShape()
finds all the soft body particles that are attached to a particular shape and
detaches them. freeVertex() detaches a specific vertex. The same vertex index
that was used to attach a position or shape can be used again with
attachVertexToGlobalPosition() or attachVertexToShape().</p>

<h2>Tearable Attachments</h2>

<p>When attaching a soft body to an actor the attachment can be flagged as
tearable using NX_SOFTBODY_ATTACHMENT_TEARABLE, this allows the soft body to
break the attachment if a sufficient force is applied to the attachment.</p>

<p>In fact the attachment is broken when the stretching constraint attached
to the object exceeds a certain factor of its rest length. This factor is
specified using:</p>
<pre>     NxSoftBodyDesc::attachmentTearFactor </pre>
<pre>     void NxSoftBody::setAttachmentTearFactor(NxReal factor) ;
     NxReal NxSoftBody::getAttachmentTearFactor();</pre>

<p>The default is 1.5 so breakable attachments break when the constraint is
stretched 50% more than its rest length.</p>
