<h1 align="center">Joint Projection</h1>
<p>Joint projection is a method for correcting large joint errors.
Joint errors occur when a joint's constraint is violated - imagine the
ball being pulled out of the socket in a spherical joint. Under normal
circumstances, joint errors are small yet unavoidable due to the
imprecise nature of floating point math and numerical integrators.
The SDK applies minimal correcting forces to the simulation to try and
reduce joint errors over time.</p>
<p>However, if a joint error becomes very&nbsp;large, more drastic
measures are necessary, such as joint projection. The SDK can, in some situations, project (or change) the position
of objects directly to fix the joint error. But when projecting the
joint it is not desirable to completely remove the joint error because the correcting forces, which also affect velocity, would
become zero.</p>
<p>To enable joint projection, set the projectionMode
member of the appropriate joint descriptor to either of the following:
<ul>
    <li>NX_JPM_POINT_MINDIST: Performs both linear and angular projection.</li>
    <li>NX_JPM_LINEAR_MINDIST: Only projects linear distances, for improved performance.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>It is also necessary to set projectionDistance to a small value greater than zero. When the joint error is larger than
projectionDistance&nbsp;the SDK will change it so that the joint error
is equal to projectionDistance. Setting&nbsp; projectionDistance too
small will introduce unwanted oscillations into the simulation.</p>
<p>The following joints support projection:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="joint_6dof.html"> 6 DOF Joints</a></li>
  <li><a href="joint_revolute.html"> Revolute Joints</a></li>
  <li><a href="joint_spherical.html"> Spherical Joints</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Joint projection is a somewhat "blunt instrument". It simply moves one actor, 
disregarding any collisions that might otherwise intervene. This may lead to penetration of collision
geometries; this is particularily inconvenient when <a href=collision_ccd.htm>CCD</a> is enabled, as
this may prevent the geometries to de-penetrate afterward. Also, it is not possible to specify which actor
is the one to move in this way.<br>
Because of this, it is recommended that joint projection be used judiciously, and avoided unless there are
real problems in tems of joint violation.</p>
